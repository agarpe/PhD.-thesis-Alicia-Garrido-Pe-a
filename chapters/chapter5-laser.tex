\chapter{CW-NIR laser as an effective neuromodulation technique}
\label{c-laser}

We saw in the previous chapter the importance of effective stimulation techniques to alter and explore the sequential neural dynamics in single neurons and circuits. In this chapter we will explore a novel neurotechnology to stimulate and modulate neural activity in a potentially noninvasive manner: Continuous-wave Near-Infrared (CW-NIR) laser. We will address its effect in single neurons dynamics in sustained and activity-dependent protocols, discussing the main biophysical candidates generating the  observed effect by the joint analysis of experimental and computational data. With a novel closed-loop protocol we will also assess  neural dynamics in the sequential activation of ionic-channels in the action potential generation.
