\chapter{Motivation and Objectives}\label{c-review}
During this work, we will analyze and explore neuronal activity focusing on their dynamics and following a bottom-up approach, . We saw in the state of art the importance of sequential dynamics, and how we can describe this sequentiality at different scales, from milliseconds (ionic channels) to hours or days in terms of behavior or cycles. It is important to study neuronal dynamics at different levels to understand the mechanisms behind the information processing and the subsequent outputs. To explore sequential activation at cell levels we will use intracellular recordings of single neurons and neurons from a CPG circuit of \textit{Lymnaea stagnalis} combining the study with conductance-based models. In the case of the CPGs we will explore the possible restrictions in the intervals contained cycle-by-cycle. Although this approach has not always been typical in these kinds of studies \parencite{anwar_interanimal_2022}, the study of the variability and time-intervals cycle-by-cycle can unveil important characteristics of their restrictions \parencite{elices_robust_2019}. Bursting activity is a good case study for this, since it is usually easier to define the phases associated to the context based on the burst events. In this work, we will discuss the generalization of sequential dynamical invariants, showed in the pyloric CPG \parencite{elices_robust_2019}, exploring it in the feeding CPG of \textit{Lymnaea stagnalis} in a computational model and experimental recordings. We will explore the restrictions underlying the CPG but also the possible functional role of these restrictions under different cases of activation of the CPG, e.g., feeding initiated by the presence of food or feeding activity initiated even in the absence of food. 

On the other hand, we also reviewed in the previous chapter the importance of stimulation techniques to explore the neural dynamics and behavior but also for possible clinical applications. In the second part of this work, we will explore Continuous-Wave Near-Infrared (CW-NIR) laser, a novel technique for neuronal dynamics modulation. This optical stimulation has potential for effective modulation of neuronal dynamics, but its exact mode of action is not known yet. There are different hypotheses, each one pointing to different candidates being affected during signal modulation in the process of the signal modulation, such as calcium channels, capacitance or long-term process as mitochondria modulation, as well as different sources for the effect, as photo-thermal or photo-chemical effect. During this work we will characterize its effect in single neurons combining experimental and theoretical approaches to narrow down the possible candidates and the source of the effect. We will also present a novel approach for closed-loop stimulation to predict spikes and stimulate at different stages of the action potential generation. 

In summary the objectives of this thesis are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Explore the sequential nature of neuronal dynamics
    \item Analyze the feeding CPG of \textit{Lymnaea stagnalis} to provide evidence of the universality of sequential dynamical invariants.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Characterize the invariants cycle-by-cycle in the bursting model. 
        \item Analyze intracellular recordings with spontaneous activity and with different rhythm initiation stimulations. 
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Study the restrictions of variability in the reproduction of neural models and circuits.
    \item Discuss the possible functionality of sequential dynamical invariants in robotics. 
    \item Test the capability of CW-NIR laser stimulation to modify neural activity. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Characterization of the effect in the spike waveform dynamics. 
        \item Analysis of the ability to change spiking activity and circuits dynamics. 
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Study the possible candidates underlying the effect in model simulation. 
    \item Design and implement a new technique for the stimulation in closed-loop. 
\end{enumerate}

Understanding the sequential patterns at the level of CPGs and single neurons allows us to identify universal principles that can be applied to broader neural circuits and behaviors. The sequential dynamics explored in the first part of this thesis provide foundational insights into the intrinsic timing mechanisms that govern neural processes. By exploring novel modulator techniques, as near-infrared laser stimulation, we bridge the gap between neural dynamics and the necessary modulation techniques. Also, will allow the precise dissection of sequential activation at ionic-channels by the activity-dependent laser illumination.
