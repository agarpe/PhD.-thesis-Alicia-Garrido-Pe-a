\chapter{Motivation and Objectives}\label{c-review}
Here you review the state of the art relevant to your thesis proposal. The idea is to present the major ideas in the state of the art right up to, but not including, your own personal brilliant ideas.

Critical analysis and comparisons should be made by pointing out the weakness of existing solutions and strengths of your proposal. You organize this section by idea, and not by author or by publication.

In certain situations, a background of the underlying concepts is required for better understanding of the research problem and also to improve the flow of the thesis. This could either be made an introductory part of this section or separately written in a prior section.
