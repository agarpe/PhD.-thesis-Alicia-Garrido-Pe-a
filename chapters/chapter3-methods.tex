\section{Electrophysiology in \textit{Lymnaea Stagnalis}}

\label{subsec:preparation}
In this thesis, intraceullular neuronal recordings have been carried out in the mollusk \textit{Lymnaea Stagnalis}. Beyond the advantages of invertebrates discussed in section \ref{c-intro-invertebrates} -- its easy accessible neural system, the size and resistance of its neurons to electrode impaling, the great pond snail's neural system is detailed described and so it is the feeding CPG which has been the model of study for chapter \ref{c-invariants} in this work. Also its slow dynamics, are convenient when studying the sequential evolution of the modulation, as in the case of the laser stimulation described along chapter \ref{c-laser}. 

The technique followed for the neural activity acquisition was intracellular recordings with filled with 3 M $KCl$ sharp electrodes, % in Figure \ref{fig:membranepotential recording} there is a scheme of the potential measurement. Está en la intro.
 In this technique, a glass micropippete penetrates the cell to record its activity, with a minimal damage on the cell, and the membrane potential is then recorded using a DC amplifier (ELC-03M, NPI Electronic, Hauptstrasse, Tamm, Germany). Micropippetes were pulled using a Sutter Instruments puller (Model P-97) (see Figure \ref{fig:electrode}). Membrane potential was recorded and recordings were acquired at 10 KHz using an A/D board (PCI-625 with a BNC-2090A DAQ device, National Instruments).

To facilitate the access to the cell, the sheath above it was reduced using protease (Sigma XVII) over the ganglion for $\sim$1 min and then washed with fresh saline. In order to record cell signals extra- and intracellularly, it is necessary to have full access to the neural system. Although there is an option to keep the buccal mass and do a semi-intact preparation \parencite{staras_cellular_1999} in this work the neural system (ganglia and nerves) was fully isolated (see \cite{garrido-pena_tfm_2022} for more details). The preparation was immersed in a saline solution (in mM: 51.3 $NaCl$, 1.7 $KCl$, 1.5 $MgCl_2\cdot6H_2O$, 4.1 $CaCl_2\cdot2H_2O$, 5 $HEPES$, corrected to pH 7.8 with 4 $M$ $NaOH$). All procedures followed the European Commission and Universidad Autónoma de Madrid animal treatment guidelines.

\section{\textit{L. stagnalis} Neural System morphology}
\label{sec:lymnaea morphology}
\textit{Lymnaea Stangalis} is a pond snail, whose neural system is shown in figure \ref{fig:lymn neural sys}. As in some other mollusks, e.g. {\sl Clione}, the neural system is conformed by several ganglia, each of them controlling (mainly, but not exclusively) some specific function of the snail. Figure \ref{fig:lymn neural sys diagram} shows a labeled image of the different ganglia in this system. All ganglia in the neural system are paired and distributed symmetrically, except from the visceral ganglion (unique) and the parietal, that although symmetrical, the right parietal is larger than left parietal ganglion (see \ref{fig:lymn neural sys diagram}). All ganglia are interconnected by nerves (grey stripes in the image). As mentioned before, each ganglion has an associated behavioural task in the snail. From top to bottom: we find the buccal ganglia (upper pair), which control the buccal muscle involved in the processes of open-rasp-swallow, known as the feeding cycle, initiated by a CPG circuit contained in these ganglia. The two cerebral ganglia (right bellow) are involved in the activation and modulation of many circuits and processes, including the modulation from specific neurons in all ganglia. Located on the sides of the diagram, the pedal ganglia control the snail pedal movements as crawling or swimming, and they are originally joined. The pleural ganglia, which contain sensory neurons, are connected to the mantle. And finally, at the bottom of the diagram, we find the parietal ganglion, involved in the control of the gill (respiratory organ) and the olfactory organ, and the visceral ganglion, connected to organs such as the intestine, the heart, and part of the genital system.

\end{figure}

Neuronal recordings showed in this work are from the CPG in the buccal ganglia (see \ref{c-invariants}) and right parietal ganglia, containing large neurons with tonic firing (see \ref{c-laser}). Both ganglia are showed in detail in figures \ref{fig:buccal ganglia}.

%%%% In contrast to other systems functionality where motoneurons are CPGs neurons \cite{stomatogastric} ((page 5 review), in Lymnaea nervous system, CPGs and motoneurons are separated groups of neurons. 


\subsection{Feeding CPG in \textit{L. stagnalis}}
%\input{chapters/methods-paper-modelo}

%For the purpose of this study, the nerves employed for the extracellular recordings are the symmetrical pair of nerves coming out from the buccal ganglia, which were originally connected to the buccal mass. Since these nerves send out the impulses to move the muscles, the neurons whose activity is recorded in the extracellular signals are mostly motoneurons \cite{Benjamin1979a}, not the ones initiating the rhythm but the ones following the CPG neurons. It is important to localize these neurons in the extracellular recording for detecting the rhythm and the patterns. 
% On the one hand, the feeding rhythm in \textit{Lymnaea} is pretty slow and it is not always active. 

\subsubsection{Lymnaea feeding rhythm}

The feeding activity of the \textit{Lymnaea}, concerning the buccal mass, is classified in three main steps: Rest, protraction, rasp and swallow. This sequence of buccal movements in the snail is generated by the motor neurons distributed in the ganglia. Each of these phases is leaded by one interneuron from the CPG: N1M, N2v, N3t, and followed by the motoneurons associated to them. This is a complex distributed system where motoneurons do not exclusively follow the interneurons but are also implied in the feeding cycle activation \cite{staras_pattern-generating_1998}. In this circuit there are also some modulatory neurons implied such as SO neuron (in the same buccal ganglia) or CGC (in the cerebral ganglia). 

Hence, an initial resting state, where the CPG as well as the moto-neurons have no activity, may change due to a sensory input. This input, received in the presence of food or during hunger, is handled in the cerebral ganglia generating activity and changing the SO tonic spiking during resting (which was inhibiting the CPG) to a bursting mode, meaning the start of the feeding cycle.


This CPG circuit can be studied in a disected preparation, since snail's neurons are active after the isolation of the system. Specially, the CPG rhythm is maintained after its activation and it is generated in an autonomous way by the neurons in the circuit. However, due to the slow dynamics of the system and the nature of the experimental setting there are different ways to initiate the rhythm. In \textit{Lymnaea} literature, several options are proposed to solve this issue. The first solution is stimulating the neurons responsible for the initiation of the feeding rhythm, such as the SO modulator neuron on the buccal ganglia or also the CBC, CVs neurons, located on brain ganglia. Stimulating these cells usually activates the target circuits \cite{benjamin_distributed_2012}. However, the access to these neurons is not always easy and it might be necessary to keep them in constant stimulation. Another option for activation discussed in the literature is appliying octopamine. Some neurons in the buccal ganglia are sensitive to octopamine and, as a result, this procedure activates the rhythm \cite{vehovszky_octopamine-containing_2004}. Alternatively, in a semi-intact preparation, it can be applied sucrose to activate the rhythm \cite{vavoulis_computational_2007,vehovszky_octopamine-containing_2004,straub_endogenous_2002}. As a foresighted option, controlling the snails' feeding and selecting the first animal approaching the food seems to be effective for obtaining the feeding rhythm, with up to 80\% of success \cite{Elliott1991}.\todo{del tfm, quitar?}

\section{NIR laser setup}

\section{Conductance based models}
For the theoretical analyses in this work, there have been used simulations of conductance-based models. As discussed in section \ref{computational neuroscience}, these models are based on a specific combination of ionic channels with a dynamic dependent on time that reproduces the Voltage value in the membrane at each time instant. There are many types of models and descriptions, depending on the specific combination of channels. Models used in this work, for both chapters \ref{c-invariants} and \ref{c-laser}, are description of neurons in \textit{Lymnaea stagnalis} for a neuron in cerebral ganglia, CGC \parencite{vavoulis_balanced_2010} and neurons in the feeding CPG in the buccal ganglia --SO, N1M, N2v, N3t, \parencite{vavoulis_computational_2007}. The first one, simulates a tonic firing and shoulder shape spike waveform, similar to the activity in some neurons in the right parietal ganglion. The second model is a detailed description of the CPG circuit with a combination of two-compartments neurons and a gradual synapse, that allows sufficient flexibility in the circuit to induce variability in the model --this will be discussed in detail in section \ref{c-invariant-models}. Equations \ref{eq:CGC}-\ref{eq:synapse} describe these to models. 

\subsection{CGC neuron model}
 This model is described by six different ionic channels: Persistent and transient sodium currents ($I_{NaP}$, $I_{NaT}$); transient and delayed rectifier potassium currents ($I_A$, $I_D$), and a low-voltage-activated and high-voltage-activated calcium currents ($I_{LVA}$, $I_{HVA}$), described by Eqs. \ref{eq:voltage} to \ref{eq:channels}. \todo{añadir para qué es cada corriente}
 
  \begin{equation}
 	C_m\frac{dV}{dt} = I_{inj} - I_{NaT} - I_{NaP} - I_{A} - I_{D} - I_{LVA} - I_{HVA},
 	\label{eq:voltage}
 \end{equation}
 
 \begin{equation}
 	I_{NaT} = g_{NaT} m_{{\infty}}^3 h (V - E_{Na}),
 \end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
 	I_{NaP} = g_{NaP} r^3 (V - E_{Na}),
 \end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
 	I_{A} = g_{A} a^4 b (V - E_{K}),
 \end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
 	I_{D} = g_{D} n^4 (V - E_{K}),
 	% \label{eq:channels}
 \end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
 	I_{LVA} = g_{LVA} c_{{\infty}}^3 d_{{\infty}} (V - E_{Ca}),
 \end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
 	I_{HVA} = g_{HVA} e^3 f (V - E_{Ca}).
 	\label{eq:channels}
 \end{equation}

Inactivation and activation dynamic variables $r,a,n,e$ and $h,b,f$ are defined by:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{x_{\infty}-x}{\tau_x},
	\end{equation}
where $x = h,r,a,b,n,e$ or $f$ and $x_{\infty}$ and $tau_x$ are defined by:

\begin{equation}
	x_{\infty} = {(1+exp(\frac{V_H^x-V}{V_S^x}))}^{-1}
\end{equation}

See Supplementary Material in \cite{vavoulis_balanced_2010} for more details.

\subsection{Feeding CPG model}
The Vavoulis et al. description of the individual neurons considers a two-compartment model to represent the soma and the axon as  differentiated structures coupled by an axial resistance \cite{Vavoulis2007}. This separation of the soma and the axon is used to regulate the interaction between the fast and slow dynamics in the model. The slow dynamics are located the soma, whereas the fast dynamics are included in the axon compartment. This distributed formalism is represented in Fig. \ref{fig:CPG diagram 2 compartments}a., where each circle represents either soma or axon, containing the different ionic currents for each one. The description of the voltage dynamics is provided by equations (\ref{eq:soma}) and (\ref{eq:axon}) for soma and axon compartments, respectively: 

\begin{equation}
	\tau_m\frac{dV_S}{dt} = i_{inj} - i_{L,S} - i_X - i_{ec,S} - i_{syn} \\,
	\quad with \quad i_X = [i_{ACh},i_{NaL},i_T]
	\label{eq:soma}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\tau_m\frac{dV_A}{dt} = -i_{L,A} - i_{NaT} - i_K - i_{ec,A}
	\label{eq:axon}
\end{equation}

\vspace{0.3in}

\noindent Here we follow the notation of~\cite{Vavoulis2007} where $\tau_m$ represents the time constant of the membrane (in ms) given by the ratio of the membrane capacitance (in nF) and the leakage conductance (in $\mu$S).  In equations \ref{eq:soma} and \ref{eq:axon}, $i$ variables (given in mV) are the product of the corresponding currents (in nA) times the passive input resistance given in M$\Omega$.
%, $i=I*R$, where  $R$ is given in M$\Omega$.

The soma compartment contains a slow current $I_X$ whose ionic nature depends on the specific CPG neuron described (see Fig.~\ref{fig:CPG diagram 2 compartments}a.). Thus, $I_X$  represents one channel, either $I_{ACh}$, $I_{NaL}$ or $I_{T}$, responsible of the specific slow dynamics associated with neurons N1M, N2v and N3t, respectively.  Along with the slow ionic channel and the leakage channel  $I_{L,S}$, the soma compartment also receives the synaptic current $I_{syn}$ and the injection current $I_{inj}$. All currents are explained in detail below.

On the other hand, fast channels are part of the axon compartment: a fast inactivating sodium current $I_{NaT}$ and a delayed rectifier potassium current $I_{K}$. These channels, along with the axon leakage channel  $I_{L,A}$ follow the definition in \cite{HODGKIN1952} model.

The model cells as described above are not endogenously bursters so to achieve bursting activity, a distinct constant value of  \(i_{inj}\) is applied to the cells. 

The CPG topology scheme is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:CPG diagram 2 compartments}, where the connections between neurons are represented by dashed or solid lines, depending on whether the connection is slow or fast, respectively, and filled or empty circles at their end denoting the direction and the effect on the postsynaptic neuron: excitation (empty circles) or inhibition (filled circles).
Individual neurons following the previous description are connected by graded synapses, defined by equations \ref{eq:syn1}-\ref{eq:syn2} \parencite{Vavoulis2007}. The differential point of a graded synapse is that it is dependent on voltage values and time, many synapses models used are just dependent on a trigger voltage value, that activates the synapse (see Figure \ref{fig:synapses-models example} ple of each type). This model of synapse allows dynamical adaptation of neurons in the circuit to maintain the rhythm despite the variability. \todo{discutir en el capítulo}

	\label{eq:syn2}
\end{equation}


\noindent where index $j$ runs over all presynaptic neurons and \(\gamma_{syn,j}, E_{syn,j},\tau_{syn},V_{pre_{V_S}}\) are the product of input resistance and maximal synaptic conductance, the synaptic reversal potential, the synaptic time constant and the presynaptic potential, respectively.

	\label{fig:model simulation}
\end{figure}

The 3 inter-neurons described in this circuit have different waveform shapes, determined by their corresponding ionic channel and the axon connectivity, in Fig. \ref{fig:model simulation}  \todo{quitar marcos} there is an example of a simulation with all neurons in the circuit. First, N1M voltage characteristics are provided by an acetylcholine sensitive channel (\(i_{ACh} = 200 * p^3 * (V_S + 30)\)), which causes the gradual spiking frequency increase as well as the visible plateau, i.e., the slow wave is sustained before hyperpolarization. On the other hand, N2v has a slowly inactivating sodium channel (\(i_{NaL} = 2 * p^3 * q^3 * (V_S-55)\)), which causes the slow depolarization in this neuron. N2v neuron has a lower spiking frequency caused by the conductance value given for the axial $g_{ec}$ linking the two compartments, which is much lower in this cell. Finally, the N3t neuron has the particularity of a post inhibitory rebound, which generates an initial fast spiking followed by a decrease in the firing rate as the burst evolves. This latter property is caused by a low-threshold calcium channel (\( i_T = 3.27 * p^3 * q *(V_S-80)\)). SO neuron has no \(I_X\) channel (in contrast to N1M, N2v and N3t neurons) so its activity is the result of the combination of the common ionic channels in the axon and the soma.

\section{CW-NIR laser}
%\input{chapters/methods/methods-paper-laser}

\subsection{Continuous-wave NIR laser stimulation}
The experimental results presented here were obtained using a continuous-wave (CW) NIR diode laser in single TEM00 operation and 830nm wavelenght output (Integrated Optics 0830L-13A-NI-PT-NF). \begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.5\textwidth}
	\includegraphics{img/laser/laser-beam.pdf}
	\caption{Illustration of the laser beam focused on a neuron in the right parietal ganglia.}
	\label{fig:laser beam}
\end{wrapfigure} 
The diode laser output was coupled to a single-mode optical fiber to efficiently guide the laser beam to the sample. To adapt the divergence of the laser beam to the fiber optic output, an aspherical lenses-collimator (Thorlabs, F280FC-850) was installed. An achromatic doublet with focal length f=50mm was used to focus the laser beam on the sample (Thorlabs AC127-050-B-ML). The experiments were performed with a laser output power of $\sim$ 90 mW and a power density over the sample of 146 W/cm². The grazing incidence of the laser beam on the sample created a quasi-elliptical spot, with a minor axis of approximately 34{\textmu}m, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:laser beam}.



The laser was attached to a micro-manipulator (Siskiyou MX160), allowing micrometer precision of the beam placement over the neuron and optimization of the beam focus. The focusing was performed using a binocular microscope (Nikon SMZ-1500) coupled to a CCD camera (XCAM1080PHA, ToupTek Photonics, Zhejiang, China).


\subsection{Sustained CW-NIR stimulation protocol}
\label{sect:sustained-protocol}
After the isolation of the \textit{Lymnaea stagnalis} neural system, we searched for suitable neurons in the right parietal ganglion, i.e., cells with spontaneous activity preferably with fast activity and shoulder or symmetrical type in the spike waveform. 
Once the target neuron was identified, the laser was set-up. A lens with focal distance of $f$=50mm was used and no polarizer was installed on the optical path. Guided with the microscope camera, the laser spot was located and then placed first over the ganglion and subsequently over the specific neuron where the electrode was recording the activity. 
At this point, the laser was focused with the micro-manipulator adjusting the focal distance. Finally, the laser power was increased to the above mentioned value for the experiments.

Once the laser spot was over the neuron while the membrane voltage was simultaneously recorded at the soma with the intracellular electrode, we followed the protocol described below to measure the effect of the CW-NIR laser on the activity of the neuron:

\begin{figure}[htb!]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/laser/trial-protocol.pdf}
	\caption{CW-NIR laser stimulation protocol sequence: Control, laser stimulation and recovery.}
	\label{fig:protocol scheme}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item First control. The spontaneous activity in the neuron was recorded for 1-3 minutes, depending on the spiking frequency of the cell. During this control, there was no external modulation of the neuron apart from the possible alteration by the intracellular procedure.  
	\item Laser stimulation. The laser was on during the same lapse of time than in the first control, stimulating the neuron with a constant optical power density. There was no modification in laser parameters during this time.
	\item Recovery. After the illumination was off, a second control was performed, under the same conditions as the first one. During this recovery control, the activity in the neuron after the effect of the laser was recorded.
\end{enumerate}



The sequence involving control, laser and recovery trials was replayed in each experiment (day and individual) for five times. Between each trial, the laser illumination was supervised to ensure that the spot was still over the neuron, guaranteeing that the procedure had as low variation as possible. Also, the laser was only turned off during the controls, it was not set aside, since that would have forced to redo the set-up for every trial altering the reproducibility between trials. The effect for each trial of a given day was very similar. 


For the analysis in Figure \ref{fig:continuous_results_panel}, the trial with the strongest effect in the day was selected. \todo{mover a capitulo}





\subsection{Activity-dependent laser stimulation protocol} 
\label{sect:methods-activity-dependent}

For stimulating the neurons depending on their ongoing activity, a closed-loop protocol was designed in the RTXI real-time software \parencite{patel_hard_2017}. This hard real-time tool allows an easy integration of new modules to read ongoing activity, process it online and send feedback in the form of analog signals. The real-time module designed for this experiment followed the scheme illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:activity dependent protocol}. After processing the signal in RTXI, a TTL pulse was sent to the controller opening the laser shutter for the desired time, and thus stimulating the neuron during that time interval. Simultaneously, the neural activity was recorded, along with the TTL and the shutter feedback (recording the shutter delay with respect to the on signal).

The CW laser light was blocked with a mechanical shutter (Thorlabs SH05, Newton NJ). The shutter utilized in this work had a $\sim 8$ ms delay from the trigger signal, which might be a limitation for neural stimulation in fast spiking cells. The slow spike dynamics in the neurons used for this research are compatible with this restriction and the protocol was developed considering this limitation. 


\begin{figure}[htb!]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/laser/activity_dependent_protocol.pdf}
	\caption{Activity-dependent protocol scheme. Neurons were recorded intracellularly and their voltage signals were processed in real-time with the RTXI software. Using the spike prediction algorithms, the shutter was triggered at the desired action potential phase illuminating the neurons.}
	\label{fig:activity dependent protocol}
\end{figure}


The main challenge in this protocol is the identification of the specific phase of the spike waveform to deliver the stimulus, i.e., predicting the spike, since spontaneous neural activity has intrinsic variability that requires the online adaptation of specific thresholds instead of a hand-tuned preset value. For this purpose, the protocol relied on the reference values from the previous spike at a specific time interval from the peak. The voltage threshold was calculated based on the voltage value measured in the previous spike, and recalculated at each spike. Thus, after each spike, the threshold for the spike prediction was updated using the following equation:

\begin{equation}
	\centering 
	V_{threshold}=V[t_{spike}[i-1]-\tau],
\end{equation}

\noindent with $\tau$ being the selected time for the prediction before the spike and $t_{spike}$ the time instant of the spike peak.

This prediction is effective for stereotyped spikes when there are only low amplitude subthreshold oscillations, but it is limited in other scenarios. Therefore, for neurons or action modes of the same neuron when it was necessary to stimulate before the depolarization raise, another reference was used: the area of the recorded voltage. In this other mode of the protocol defined in Eq. \ref{eq:area}, the voltage was accumulated along the activity and the sum was reset after each spike. 

\begin{equation}
	\centering 
	V_{area}=\int_{V[spike_{i-1}]}^{V[spike_{i}]}V(t).
	\label{eq:area}
\end{equation}

The stimulation was triggered when the area reached a specific threshold, which was predicted as in the voltage case, or hand-tuned. For the detection of the minimum point to reset the voltage area, we used a RTXI module based on RTHybrid, a real-time software that includes automatic adaptation algorithms to handle the ongoing variability of the recordings \parencite{amaducci_rthybrid_2019,reyes-sanchez_automatic_2020,reyes-sanchez_automatized_2023}, \href{https://github.com/GNB-UAM/rthybrid-for-rtxi/tree/master/rthybrid_burst_analysis}{github.com/GNB-UAM/RTHybrid-For-RTXI}. The use of each mode of the protocol in the experiment was decided depending on the specific requirements of the recorded activity. 

\begin{figure}[htb!]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/laser/offset_examples.pdf}
	\caption{Examples of illumination offset, defined as the time interval from the end of the illumination to the peak of the spike.}
	\label{fig:offset_example}
\end{figure}

Using this detection protocol, we assessed the effect of the illumination at different phases of the action potential in the range from 100 ms before the spike peak to 80 ms after the spike peak (see an example of the illumination offset in Fig. \ref{fig:offset_example}). The illumination interval was 58 ms, validated as the minimal duration for effective stimulation in the test trials. The RTXI module programmed for this study is available at \href{https://github.com/GNB-UAM/spike_predictor}{github.com/GNB-UAM/spike\_predictor}.

To estimate the CW-NIR laser induced temperature change, we used the open-pipette method employed in previous experimental studies to measure the temperature variation during the illumination \parencite{li_temporal_2013, rabbitt_heat_2016,brown_thermal_2020, brown_response_2021}. We calibrated the resistance and temperature relation using a thermistor (EPCOS, 10$k\Omega$) to measure the temperature in the preparation solution in the range from 23ºC to 29ºC. We used two protocols:  injecting a constant current to calculate the resistance change from the voltage recording, and injecting pulses of a specific current value. From the resulting recording slope of the linear regression, we computed the conversion from voltage to temperature. For the estimation of the temperature change during the laser stimulation, we measured the voltage change during short intervals of laser illumination and the temperature value at its saturation plateau. This estimation is represented in Fig. \ref{fig:temperature estimation}.
