\section{Electrophysiology in \textit{Lymnaea Stagnalis}}

\label{subsec:preparation}
In this thesis, intraceullular neuronal recordings have been carried out in the mollusk \textit{Lymnaea Stagnalis}. Beyond the advantages of invertebrates discussed in section \ref{c-intro-invertebrates} -- its easy accessible neural system, the size and resistance of its neurons to electrode impaling, the great pond snail's neural system is detailed described and so it is the feeding CPG which has been the model of study for chapter \ref{c-invariants} in this work. Also its slow dynamics, are convenient when studying the sequential evolution of the modulation, as in the case of the laser stimulation described along chapter \ref{c-laser}. 

The technique followed for the neural activity acquisition was intracellular recordings with filled with 3 M $KCl$ sharp electrodes, in Figure \ref{fig:membranepotential recording} there is a scheme of the potential measurement. In this technique, a glass micropippete penetrates the cell to record its activity, with a minimal damage on the cell, and the membrane potential is then recorded using a DC amplifier (ELC-03M, NPI Electronic, Hauptstrasse, Tamm, Germany). Micropippetes were pulled using a Sutter Instruments puller (Model P-97) (see Figure \ref{fig:electrode}). Membrane potential was recorded and recordings were acquired at 10 KHz using an A/D board (PCI-625 with a BNC-2090A DAQ device, National Instruments).

To facilitate the access to the cell, the sheath above it was reduced using protease (Sigma XVII) over the ganglion for $\sim$1 min and then washed with fresh saline. In order to record cell signals extra- and intracellularly, it is necessary to have full access to the neural system. Although there is an option to keep the buccal mass and do a semi-intact preparation \parencite{Staras1999} in this work the neural system (ganglia and nerves) was fully isolated (see \cite{garrido-pena_tfm_2022} for more details). The preparation was immersed in a saline solution (in mM: 51.3 $NaCl$, 1.7 $KCl$, 1.5 $MgCl_2\cdot6H_2O$, 4.1 $CaCl_2\cdot2H_2O$, 5 $HEPES$, corrected to pH 7.8 with 4 $M$ $NaOH$). All procedures followed the European Commission and Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid animal treatment guidelines.

\section{\textit{L. stagnalis} Neural System morphology}

\textit{Lymnaea Stangalis} is a pond snail, whose neural system is shown in figure \ref{fig:lymn neural sys}. As in some other mollusks, e.g. {\sl Clione}, the neural system is conformed by several ganglia, each of them controlling (mainly, but not exclusively) some specific function of the snail. Figure \ref{fig:lymn neural sys diagram} shows a labeled image of the different ganglia in this system. All ganglia in the neural system are paired and distributed symmetrically, except from the visceral ganglion (unique) and the parietal, that although symmetrical, the right parietal is larger than left parietal ganglion (see \ref{fig:lymn neural sys diagram}). All ganglia are interconnected by nerves (grey stripes in the image). As mentioned before, each ganglion has an associated behavioural task in the snail. From top to bottom: we find the buccal ganglia (upper pair), which control the buccal muscle involved in the processes of open-rasp-swallow, known as the feeding cycle, initiated by a CPG circuit contained in these ganglia. The two cerebral ganglia (right bellow) are involved in the activation and modulation of many circuits and processes, including the modulation from specific neurons in all ganglia. Located on the sides of the diagram, the pedal ganglia control the snail pedal movements as crawling or swimming, and they are originally joined. The pleural ganglia, which contain sensory neurons, are connected to the mantle. And finally, at the bottom of the diagram, we find the parietal ganglion, involved in the control of the gill (respiratory organ) and the olfactory organ, and the visceral ganglion, connected to organs such as the intestine, the heart, and part of the genital system.

Neuronal recordings showed in this work are from the CPG in the buccal ganglia (see \ref{c-invariants}) and right parietal ganglia, containing large neurons with tonic firing (see \ref{c-laser}). Both ganglia are showed in detail in figures \ref{fig:buccal ganglia}.

%%%% In contrast to other systems functionality where motoneurons are CPGs neurons \cite{stomatogastric} ((page 5 review), in Lymnaea nervous system, CPGs and motoneurons are separated groups of neurons. 


\subsection{Feeding CPG in \textit{L. stagnalis}}
%\input{chapters/methods-paper-modelo}

%For the purpose of this study, the nerves employed for the extracellular recordings are the symmetrical pair of nerves coming out from the buccal ganglia, which were originally connected to the buccal mass. Since these nerves send out the impulses to move the muscles, the neurons whose activity is recorded in the extracellular signals are mostly motoneurons \cite{Benjamin1979a}, not the ones initiating the rhythm but the ones following the CPG neurons. It is important to localize these neurons in the extracellular recording for detecting the rhythm and the patterns. 
% On the one hand, the feeding rhythm in \textit{Lymnaea} is pretty slow and it is not always active. 

\subsubsection{Lymnaea feeding rhythm}

The feeding activity of the \textit{Lymnaea}, concerning the buccal mass, is classified in three main steps: Rest, protraction, rasp and swallow. This sequence of buccal movements in the snail is generated by the motor neurons distributed in the ganglia. Each of these phases is leaded by one interneuron from the CPG: N1M, N2v, N3t, and followed by the motoneurons associated to them. This is a complex distributed system where motoneurons do not exclusively follow the interneurons but are also implied in the feeding cycle activation \cite{Staras1998}. In this circuit there are also some modulatory neurons implied such as SO neuron (in the same buccal ganglia) or CGC (in the cerebral ganglia). 

Hence, an initial resting state, where the CPG as well as the moto-neurons have no activity, may change due to a sensory input. This input, received in the presence of food or during hunger, is handled in the cerebral ganglia generating activity and changing the SO tonic spiking during resting (which was inhibiting the CPG) to a bursting mode, meaning the start of the feeding cycle.


This CPG circuit can be studied in a disected preparation, since snail's neurons are active after the isolation of the system. Specially, the CPG rhythm is maintained after its activation and it is generated in an autonomous way by the neurons in the circuit. However, due to the slow dynamics of the system and the nature of the experimental setting there are different ways to initiate the rhythm. In \textit{Lymnaea} literature, several options are proposed to solve this issue. The first solution is stimulating the neurons responsible for the initiation of the feeding rhythm, such as the SO modulator neuron on the buccal ganglia or also the CBC, CVs neurons, located on brain ganglia. Stimulating these cells usually activates the target circuits \cite{Benjamin2012}. However, the access to these neurons is not always easy and it might be necessary to keep them in constant stimulation. Another option for activation discussed in the literature is appliying octopamine. Some neurons in the buccal ganglia are sensitive to octopamine and, as a result, this procedure activates the rhythm \cite{Vehovszky2004}. Alternatively, in a semi-intact preparation, it can be applied sucrose to activate the rhythm \cite{Vavoulis2007,Vehovszky2004,Straub2002}. As a foresighted option, controlling the snails' feeding and selecting the first animal approaching the food seems to be effective for obtaining the feeding rhythm, with up to 80\% of success \cite{Elliott1991}.\todo{del tfm, quitar?}
