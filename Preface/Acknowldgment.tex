Glory be to Allah (S.W.A), the Creator, the Sustainer of the Universe. Who only has the power to honour whom He please, and to abase whom He please. Verily no one can do anything without His will. From the day, I came to NUST till the day of my departure, He was the only one Who blessed me and opened ways for me, and showed me the path of success. Their is nothing which can payback for His bounties throughout my research period to complete it successfully.
