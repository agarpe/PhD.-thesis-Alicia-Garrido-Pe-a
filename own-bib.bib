  abstract = {Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) are neural circuits that generate robust coordinated neural activity to control motor rhythms. Many CPGs are convenient neural circuits for locomotion control in autonomous robots. In this context, invertebrate CPGs are key networks to understand rhythm generation and coordination, as their cells and connections can be identified and mapped, like in the crustacean pyloric CPG. Experiments during the last decades have shown that mutual inhibition by chemical synapses together with electrical coupling underlie the timing of neuron activations that shape each rhythm cycle of this CPG. Due to the presence of inhibitory and electrical synapses, regular and irregular triphasic spiking-bursting activity can be found in the pyloric CPG, always preserving the same neuron activation sequence. In this study, we use a model of this well-known CPG to assess the role of electrical synapses in shaping the cycle-by-cycle period and individual cell burst duration. We show that electrical coupling strength asymmetrically affects the burst duration of each individual neuron, as well as the overall cycle-by-cycle duration. Our results support the view that electrical coupling largely contributes to shape the intervals that define functional sequences in CPGs, which can be applied in bioinspired autonomous robotic motor control.},

  abstract = {Central pattern generators (CPG) are neural circuits that generate robust sequences of coordinated neural activity to control motor rhythms. We have recently revealed the presence of dynamical invariants in the relationships between specific intervals that build the CPG sequence and the instantaneous period of the rhythm in the pyloric CPG of crustacean. In this paper, we analyze the variability of the intervals comprising the rhythm in a model of a mollusk feeding CPG. We measured the cycle-by-cycle time intervals of the CPG rhythm under distinct single neuron stimulation. We characterized interval variability and report dynamical invariants found only for specific time intervals building the sequence of the feeding CPG. Together with our previous findings, the results reported in this paper indicate that dynamical invariants can be a universal feature of any sequence generating circuit.},

  abstract = {Near-Infrared (NIR) laser is an emerging stimulation technique that has proven its effectiveness as an excitatory stimulus when delivered as high-frequency pulses with potential in future clinical applications. Many studies have focused on the general effect with stationary analyses and not on the spike dynamics and the associated biophysical sources of the modulation.We have explored the effect of continuous-wave (CW)-NIR laser in neurons of Lymnaea stagnalis using sustained and activity-dependent protocols. Sustained illumination has a large potential, but it has been eclipsed by pulsed-laser stimulation, usually claimed to be less invasive. We show how sustained CW-NIR laser illumination safely and effectively modulates the firing rate and neuronal waveform affecting the duration and the spike dynamics, with a minimal effect on amplitude.Using model simulations, we investigated the distinct biophysical candidates behind this effect, finding that no candidate alone was enough to explain the observed phenomena. A temperature model globally affecting the cell biophysics achieved the most accurate reproduction of the observed experimental results, supporting the key role of temperature for the laser modulation.We also present the results using a novel activity-dependent protocol. Controlling a shutter with a real-time software, we detected and predicted the spike generation and assessed its dynamics at distinct stages, e.g., by illuminating the neuron only during depolarization. The analysis highlights the importance of the illumination instant and the relation between thermal dynamics and the observed effect. This protocol can be generalized for clinical interventions as a noninvasive closed-loop CW-NIR stimulation neurotechnology.},

  abstract = {SignificanceNear-infrared laser illumination is a non-invasive alternative/complement to classical stimulation methods in neuroscience but the mechanisms underlying its action on neuronal dynamics remain unclear. Most studies deal with high-frequency pulsed protocols and stationary characterizations disregarding the dynamic modulatory effect of sustained and activity-dependent stimulation. The understanding of such modulation and its widespread dissemination can help to develop specific interventions for research applications and treatments for neural disorders.AimWe quantified the effect of continuous-wave near-infrared (CW-NIR) laser illumination on single neuron dynamics using sustained stimulation and an open-source activity-dependent protocol to identify the biophysical mechanisms underlying this modulation and its time course.ApproachWe characterized the effect by simultaneously performing long intracellular recordings of membrane potential while delivering sustained and closed-loop CW-NIR laser stimulation. We used waveform metrics and conductance-based models to assess the role of specific biophysical candidates on the modulation.ResultsWe show that CW-NIR sustained illumination asymmetrically accelerates action potential dynamics and the spiking rate on single neurons, while closed-loop stimulation unveils its action at different phases of the neuron dynamics. Our model study points out the action of CW-NIR on specific ionic-channels and the key role of temperature on channel properties to explain the modulatory effect.ConclusionsBoth sustained and activity-dependent CW-NIR stimulation effectively modulate neuronal dynamics by a combination of biophysical mechanisms. Our open-source protocols can help to disseminate this non-invasive optical stimulation in novel research and clinical applications.},
