  abstract = {Bioelectronic medicine is driving the need for neuromorphic microcircuits that integrate raw nervous stimuli and respond identically to biological neurons. However, designing such circuits remains a challenge. Here we estimate the parameters of highly nonlinear conductance models and derive the ab~initio equations of intracellular currents and membrane voltages embodied in analog solid-state electronics. By configuring individual ion channels of solid-state neurons with parameters estimated from large-scale assimilation of electrophysiological recordings, we successfully transfer the complete dynamics of hippocampal and respiratory neurons in~silico. The solid-state neurons are found to respond nearly identically to biological neurons under stimulation by a wide range of current injection protocols. The optimization of nonlinear models demonstrates a powerful method for programming analog electronic circuits. This approach offers a route for repairing diseased biocircuits and emulating their function with biomedical implants that can adapt to biofeedback.},

The biocompatibility of the rGONMs in growth of hNSCs was found similar to that of the graphene oxide (GO) sheets. Proliferation of the hNSCs on the GONMs was assigned to the excess oxygen functional groups formed on edge defects of the GONMs, resulting in superhydrophilicity of the surface. Under NIR laser stimulation, the graphene layers (especially the rGONMs) exhibited significant cell differentiations, including more elongations of the cells and higher differentiation of neurons than glia. The higher hNSC differentiation on the rGONM than the reduced GO (rGO) was assigned to the stimulation effects of the low-energy photoexcited electrons injected from the rGONM semiconductors into the cells, while the high-energy photoelectrons of the rGO (as a zero band-gap semiconductor) could suppress the cell proliferation and/or even cause cell damages. Using conventional heating of the culture media up to 43. {$^\circ$}C (the temperature typically reached under the laser irradiation), no significant differentiation was observed in dark. This further confirmed the role of photoelectrons in the hNSC differentiation.},

  abstract = {The pleural interneuron PlB is a white neuron in the pleural ganglion of the snail Lymnaea. We test the hypothesis that it inhibits neurons at all levels of the feeding system, using a combination of anatomy, physiology and pharmacology. There is just one PlB in each pleural ganglion. Its axon traverses the pedal and cerebral ganglia, running into the buccal ganglia. It has neuropilar branches in the regions of the cerebral and buccal ganglia where neurons that are active during feeding also branch. Activation of the PlB blocks fictive feeding, whether the feeding rhythm occurs spontaneously or is driven by a modulatory interneuron. The PlB inhibits all the neurons in the feeding network, including protraction and retraction motoneurons, central pattern generator interneurons, buccal modulatory interneurons (SO, OC), and cerebral modulatory interneurons (CV1, CGC). Only the CV1 interneuron shows discrete 1:1 IPSPs; all other effects are slow, smooth hyperpolarizations. All connections persist in Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ -rich saline, which reduces polysynaptic effects. The inhibitory effects are mimicked by 0.5 to 100 {$\mu$}moll -1  FMRFamide, which the PlB soma contains. We conclude that the PlB inhibits neurons in the feeding system at all levels, probably acting though the peptide transmitter FMRFamide. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

Yet, development of clinical applications has been impeded by lack of information about the molecular mechanisms underlying the laser-induced neural response. Here, we directly address this question through pharmacological characterization of the biological response evoked by midinfrared irradiation of isolated retinal and vestibular ganglion cells from rodents. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings reveal that both voltagegated calcium and sodium channels contribute to the laser-evoked neuronal voltage variations (LEVV). In addition, selective blockade of the LEVV by micromolar concentrations of ruthenium red and RN 1734 identifies thermosensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid channels as the primary effectors of the chain reaction triggered by midinfrared laser irradiation. These results have the potential to facilitate greatly the design of future prosthetic devices aimed at restoring neurosensory capacities in disabled patients. {\copyright} 2012 the American Physiological Society.},

Each membrane conductance has a different characteristic temperature sensitivity, which raises the question of how neurons and neuronal circuits can operate robustly over wide temperature ranges. To address this, we employed computational models of the pyloric network of crabs and lobsters. We produced multiple different models that exhibit a triphasic pyloric rhythm over a range of temperatures and explored the dynamics of their currents and how they change with temperature. Temperature can produce smooth changes in the relative contributions of the currents to neural activity so that neurons and networks undergo graceful transitions in the mechanisms that give rise to their activity patterns. Moreover, responses of the models to deletions of a current can be different at high and low temperatures, indicating that even a well-defined genetic or pharmacological manipulation may produce qualitatively distinct effects depending on the temperature.},

These protocols are often difficult to implement due to the temporal precision required when interacting with biological components, which in many cases can only be achieved using real-time technology. In this paper we introduce RTHybrid (www.github.com/GNB-UAM/RTHybrid), a free and open-source software that includes a neuron and synapse model library to build hybrid circuits with living neurons in a wide variety of experimental contexts. In an effort to encourage the standardization of real-time software technology in neuroscience research, we compared different open-source real-time operating system patches, RTAI, Xenomai 3 and Preempt-RT, according to their performance and usability. RTHybrid has been developed to run over Linux operating systems supporting both Xenomai 3 and Preempt-RT real-time patches, and thus allowing an easy implementation in any laboratory. We report a set of validation tests and latency benchmarks for the construction of hybrid circuits using this library. With this work we want to promote the dissemination of standardized, user-friendly and open-source software tools developed for open- and closed-loop experimental neuroscience.},

We adopted a neuromorphic board which is able to perform real-time event detection and trigger an electrical stimulation of the BNN. This system embeds an ANN, based on Izhikevich neurons which can be put in uni- and bi-directional communication with the BNN. The ANN used in the following experiments was made up of 20 excitatory neurons with inhibition synapse and with synaptic plasticity to design central pattern generator. Open-loop and closed-loop hybrid experiments show that the biological dynamics can be modified. This work can be seen as the first step towards the realization of an innovative neuroprosthesis.},

Yet, the phase relationships between neurons in oscillatory circuits are often maintained, even in the face of varying oscillation frequencies. We examined whether synaptic and intrinsic currents are matched to maintain constant activity phases across preparations, using the lateral pyloric (LP) neuron of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab, Cancer borealis. LP produces stable oscillatory bursts on release from inhibition, with an onset phase that is independent of oscillation frequency. We quantified the parameters that define the shape of the synaptic current inputs across preparations and found no linear correlations with voltage-gated currents. However, several synaptic parameters were correlated with oscillation period and burst onset phase, suggesting they may play a role in phase maintenance. We used dynamic clamp to apply artificial synaptic inputs and found that those synaptic parameters correlated with phase and period were ineffective in influencing burst onset. Instead, parameters that showed the least variability across preparations had the greatest influence. Thus, parameters that influence circuit phasing are constrained across individuals, while those that have little effect simply co-vary with phase and frequency.},

The most frequent patterns were left and right posterior-temporal delta brushes which were associated in the left hemisphere with ipsilateral BOLD activation in the insula only; and in the right hemisphere in both the insular and temporal cortices. This direct measure of neural and hemodynamic activity shows that the insula, one of the most densely connected hubs in the developing cortex, is a major source of the transient bursting events that are critical for brain maturation.},

  abstract = {Patterned illumination using a digital micromirror device (DMD) is a powerful tool for optogenetics. Compared to a scanning laser, DMDs are inexpensive and can easily create complex illumination patterns. Combining these complex spatiotemporal illumination patterns with optogenetics allows DMD-equipped microscopes to probe neural circuits by selectively manipulating the activity of many individual cells or many subcellular regions at the same time. To use DMDs to study neural activity, scientists must develop specialized software to coordinate optical stimulation patterns with the acquisition of electrophysiological and fluorescence data. To meet this growing need we have developed an open source optical pattern generation software for neuroscience---NeuroPG---that combines, DMD control, sample visualization, and data acquisition in one application. Built on a MATLAB platform, NeuroPG can also process, analyze, and visualize data. The software is designed specifically for the Mightex Polygon400; however, as an open source package, NeuroPG can be modified to incorporate any data acquisition, imaging, or illumination equipment that is compatible with MATLAB's Data Acquisition and Image Acquisition toolboxes.},

  abstract = {C. elegans has a highly developed chemosensory system that enables it to detect a wide variety of volatile (olfactory) and water-soluble (gustatory) cues associated with food, danger, or other animals. Much of its nervous system and more than 5\% of its genes are devoted to the recognition of environmental chemicals. Chemosensory cues can elicit chemotaxis, rapid avoidance, changes in overall motility, and entry into and exit from the alternative dauer developmental stage. These behaviors are regulated primarily by the amphid chemosensory organs, which contain eleven pairs of chemosensory neurons. Each amphid sensory neuron expresses a specific set of candidate receptor genes and detects a characteristic set of attractants, repellents, or pheromones. About 500--1000 different G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are expressed in chemosensory neurons, and these may be supplemented by alternative sensory pathways as well. Downstream of the GPCRs, two signal transduction systems are prominent in chemosensation, one that uses cGMP as a second messenger to open cGMP-gated channels, and one that relies upon TRPV channels. These sensory pathways are modulated and fine-tuned by kinases and phosphatases. Chemosensory preferences can be modified by sensory adaptation, developmental history, and associative learning, allowing C. elegans to integrate context and experience into its behavior.},

  abstract = {Neurons react differently to incoming stimuli depending upon their previous history of stimulation. This property can be considered as a single-cell substrate for transient memory, or context-dependent information processing: depending upon the current context that the neuron "sees" through the subset of the network impinging on it in the immediate past, the same synaptic event can evoke a postsynaptic spike or just a subthreshold depolarization. We propose a formal definition of History-Dependent Excitability (HDE) as a measure of the propensity to firing in any moment in time, linking the subthreshold history-dependent dynamics with spike generation. This definition allows the quantitative assessment of the intrinsic memory for different single-neuron dynamics and input statistics. We illustrate the concept of HDE by considering two general dynamical mechanisms: the passive behavior of an Integrate and Fire (IF) neuron, and the inductive behavior of a Generalized Integrate and Fire (GIF) neuron with subthreshold damped oscillations. This framework allows us to characterize the sensitivity of different model neurons to the detailed temporal structure of incoming stimuli. While a neuron with intrinsic oscillations discriminates equally well between input trains with the same or different frequency, a passive neuron discriminates better between inputs with different frequencies. This suggests that passive neurons are better suited to rate-based computation, while neurons with subthreshold oscillations are advantageous in a temporal coding scheme. We also address the influence of intrinsic properties in single-cell processing as a function of input statistics, and show that intrinsic oscillations enhance discrimination sensitivity at high input rates. Finally, we discuss how the recognition of these cell-specific discrimination properties might further our understanding of neuronal network computations and their relationships to the distribution and functional connectivity of different neuronal types.},

In this paper we show that the intrinsic properties of the postsynaptic neuron might have a deep influence on STDP dynamics by shaping the causal correlation between the pre- and the postsynaptic spike trains. The cell-specific effect of STDP is particularly evident in the presence of an oscillatory component in a cell input. In this case, the cell-specific phase response to an oscillatory modulation biases the oscillating afferents towards potentiation or depression, depending upon the intrinsic dynamics of the postsynaptic neuron and the period of the modulation. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Inner ear spiral ganglion neurons were cultured from day 4 postnatal mice and loaded with a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator (fluo-4,-5F, or-5N). Pulses of infrared radiation (IR; 1,863 nm, 200 {\textmu}s, 200--250 Hz for 2--5 s, delivered via an optical fiber) produced a rapid, transient temperature increase of 6--12{$^\circ$}C (above a baseline of 24--30{$^\circ$}C). These IR pulse trains evoked transient increases in both nuclear and cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]) of 0.20--1.4 {\textmu}M, with a simultaneous reduction of [Ca2+] in regions containing endoplasmic reticulum (ER). IR-induced increases in cytosolic [Ca2+] continued in medium containing no added Ca2+ ({\textpm}Ca2+ buffers) and low [Na+], indicating that the [Ca2+] increase was mediated by release from intracellular stores. Consistent with this hypothesis, the IR-induced [Ca2+] response was prolonged and eventually blocked by inhibition of ER Ca2+-ATPase with cyclopiazonic acid, and was also inhibited by a high concentration of ryanodine and by inhibitors of inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP3)-mediated Ca2+ release (xesto-spongin C and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate). The thermal sensitivity of the response suggested involvement of warmth-sensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. The IR-induced [Ca2+] increase was inhibited by TRPV4 inhibitors (HC-067047 and GSK-2193874), and immunostaining of spiral ganglion cultures demonstrated the presence of TRPV4 and TRPM2 that colocalized with ER marker GRP78. These results suggest that the temperature sensitivity of IR-induced [Ca2+] elevations is conferred by TRP channels on ER membranes, which facilitate Ca2+ efflux into the cytosol and thereby contribute to Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release via IP3 and ryanodine receptors. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Infrared radiation-induced photothermal effects release Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum of primary spiral ganglion neurons. This Ca2+ release is mediated by activation of transient receptor potential (TRPV4) channels and involves amplification by Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release. The neurons immunostained for warmth-sensitive channels, TRPV4 and TRPM2, which colocalize with endoplasmic reticulum. Pulsed infrared radiation provides a novel experimental tool for releasing intracellular Ca2+, studying Ca2+ regulatory mechanisms, and influencing neuronal excitability.},

Second, dynamic-clamp methods allow the addition of new, "virtual" membrane mechanisms to living cells. Dynamic clamp allows researchers unprecedented ways of testing computationally based hypotheses in biological preparations.

  abstract = {The vision of patients rendered blind by photoreceptor degeneration can be partially restored by exogenous stimulation of surviving retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Whereas conventional electrical stimulation techniques have failed to produce naturalistic visual percepts, nanoparticle-based optical sensors have recently received increasing attention as a means to artificially stimulate the RGCs. In particular, nanoparticle-enhanced infrared neural modulation (NINM) is a plasmonically mediated photothermal neuromodulation technique that has a demonstrated capacity for both stimulation and inhibition, which is essential for the differential modulation of ON-type and OFF-type RGCs. Gold nanorods provide tunable absorption through the near-infrared wavelength window, which reduces interference with any residual vision. Therefore, NINM may be uniquely well-suited to retinal prosthesis applications but, to our knowledge, has not previously been demonstrated in RGCs. In the present study, NINM laser pulses of 100 {$\mu$}s, 500 {$\mu$}s and 200 ms were applied to RGCs in explanted rat retinae, with single-cell responses recorded via patch-clamping. The shorter laser pulses evoked robust RGC stimulation by capacitive current generation, while the long laser pulses are capable of inhibiting spontaneous action potentials by thermal block. Importantly, an implicit bias toward OFF-type inhibition is observed, which may have important implications for the feasibility of future high-acuity retinal prosthesis design based on nanoparticle sensors.},

Food ingestion in this animal involves sequences of rhythmic biting movements that are initiated by the application of a chemical food stimulus to the lips and esophagus. We investigated how individual neurons contribute to various network functions that are required for the generation of feeding behavior such as rhythm generation, initiation ('decision making'), modulation and hunger and satiety. The data support the view that feeding behavior is generated by a distributed type of network organization with individual neurons often contributing to more than one network function, sharing roles with other neurons. Multitasking in a distributed type of network would be 'economically' sensible in the Lymnaea feeding system where only about 100 neurons are available to carry out a variety of complex tasks performed by millions of neurons in the vertebrate nervous system. Having complementary and potentially alternative mechanisms for network functions would also add robustness to what is a 'noisy' network where variable firing rates and synaptic strengths are commonly encountered in electrophysiological recording experiments.},

  abstract = {The passive electrotonic properties of neurones VD1 and RPD2 in the brain of the snail Lymnaea can be represented by a soma-finite cable model with closed-circuit axon termination. There is a considerable individual variation in input resistance, membrane time constant, electrotonic length and axon-soma conductance ratio, but the average values for these parameters are similar in the two neurones. The cells are tightly coupled by an electrotonic synapse giving an average steady-state coupling coefficient of 0.68 and an average resistance measured between recording sites in the cell bodies of 20 M omega. Calculations using a model consisting of a symmetrical pair of cells with standard values for the electrotonic parameters show that in this system, for a soma-soma resistance of 20 M omega, the junction cannot be more than 0.16 length constants from the cell bodies. Reduction in coupling due to membrane current losses in such short proximal axon segments is insignificant. Intra-axonal recordings indicate that most of the coupling resistance is located at the junction between VD1 and RPD2, which must therefore be closer to the cell bodies than the limiting value of 0.16 length constants assuming an electrical equivalent model which includes the standard electrotonic parameters. If all the soma-soma resistance is located at the junction, then it could be physically a single array of gap-junction particles. Despite its low conductance (1/20 M omega = 50 nS) and possibly small physical dimensions, the electrotonic synapse is more than sufficient to ensure spike synchrony in the two cells.},

Changes in neural activity following conditioning could be recorded at the level of motoneurons, central pattern generator interneurons and modulatory neurons. Of significant interest was recent work showing that neural correlates of long-term memory could be recorded in the feeding network following single-trial appetitive chemical conditioning.

  abstract = {Motor coordination by the nervous system involves generating and coordinating muscle sequential activity. Such activity must be robust to produce effective motion that relies on patterned motor events ordered in a specific sequence and, at the same time, flexible in timing and duration to adapt to intrinsic and environmental circumstances. Motor neural circuits produce the signaling that muscles use for their sequential action. Even in rhythmic repetitive motion such as walking, breathing and chewing, variability in the timing of the events that build the sequence can be observed within the overall ordered rhythm of the motion. In this context, central pattern generators (CPGs) are key neural circuits to study the cycle-by-cycle balance between the robustness of the sequential order of neural events and the irregularity of the intracycle intervals that shape a rhythmic sequence. Recently, the presence of sequential dynamical invariants in the form of robust cycle-by-cycle relationships between specific sequence time intervals was unveiled in living CPGs. Variability of other sequence intervals remains unrelated and coexists with the presence of the invariants. Sequential dynamical invariants have been proposed to underlie the cycle-by-cycle CPG coordination. In this work, we used a minimal CPG circuit building block of two interacting inhibitory model neurons to assess the emergence of coordinated variability in sequential neural activity. We studied the conditions that produce sequential dynamical invariants in the circuit using intrinsically irregular neuron models and symmetric and asymmetric network topologies. We quantified the circuit irregularity and related it to the presence of invariants under different configurations. We found the conditions to propagate and sustain coordinated variability between time intervals, and thus our study illustrates the auto-organized constraint-based mechanisms for motor sequence coordination that shape sequential dynamical invariants. This is the first model study in which sequential dynamical invariants are observed considering only the intrinsic variability of CPG neurons without external stimuli. Finally, we discuss possible applications of this research in the context of autonomous robotics and artificial intelligence.},

This system is the subject of an intensive concerted effort to understand the behaviour of an entire living animal, from the bottom up and the top down. C. elegans locomotion, in particular, has been the subject of a number of models, but there is as yet no general agreement about the key (rhythm generating) elements. In this paper we investigate the role of one component of the locomotion subsystem, namely the body wall muscles, with a focus on the role of inter-muscular gap junctions. We construct a detailed electrophysiological model which suggests that these muscles function, to a first approximation, as mere actuators and have no obvious rhythm generating role. Furthermore, we show that within our model inter-muscular coupling is too weak to have a significant electrical effect. These results rule out muscles as key generators of locomotion, pointing instead to neural activity patterns. More specifically, the results imply that the reduced locomotion velocity observed in unc-9 mutants is likely to be due to reduced neuronal rather than inter-muscular coupling. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Behavioral function of glutamatergic interneurons in the feeding system of Lymnaea: plateauing properties and synaptic connections with motor neurons. J. Neurophysiol. 78: 3386--3395, 1997. Intracellular recording techniques were used to examine the electrical properties and behavioral function of a novel type of retraction phase interneuron, the N2 ventral (N2v) cells in the feeding network of the snail Lymnaea. The N2vs were compared with the previously identified N2 cells that now are renamed the N2 dorsal (N2d) cells. The N2vs are a bilaterally symmetrical pair of electrotonically coupled plateauing interneurons that are located on the ventral surfaces of the buccal ganglia. Their main axons project to the opposite buccal ganglion, but they have an additional fine process in the postbuccal nerve. N2v plateaus that outlast the duration of the stimulus can be triggered by depolarizing current pulses and prematurely terminated by applied hyperpolarizing pulses. Gradually increasing the amplitude of depolarizing pulses reveals a clear threshold for plateau initiation. N2v plateauing persists in a high Mg 2+ /nominally zero Ca 2+ saline that blocks chemical synaptic connections, suggesting an endogenous mechanism for plateau generation. The N2vs fire sustained bursts of action potentials throughout the N2/rasp phase of the fictive feeding cycle and control the retraction phase feeding motor neurons. The N2vs excite the B3 and B9 feeding motor neurons to fire during the rasp phase of the feeding cycle. They also inhibit the B7 and B8 feeding motor neurons. The B8 cells recover from inhibition and fire during the following swallowing phase. These synaptic connections appear to be monosynaptic as they persist in high Mg 2+ /high Ca 2+ (HiDi) saline that blocks polysynaptic pathways. Strong current-induced plateaus in the N2vs generate brief inhibitory postsynaptic responses in the B4CL rasp phase motor neurons, but this was due to the indirect N2v {$\rightarrow$} N2d {$\rightarrow$} B4CL pathway. The N2vs are coupled electrotonically to the N2d cells, and triggering plateau in a N2v usually induced one or two spikes in a N2d. Previous experiments showed that the N2ds generate plateau potentials during a fictive feeding cycle. Here we show that the main component of the ``plateauing'' waveform is due to the electrotonic coupling with the N2v cells. The differential synaptic connections of the N2v and N2d cells with retraction phase motor neurons results in a sequence of motor neuron burst activity B9 {$\rightarrow$} B4CL {$\rightarrow$} B8 that produces the full retraction (rasp {$\rightarrow$} swallow) movements of the feeding apparatus (buccal mass). We conclude that the N2v cells are an essential component of the interneuronal network required to produce feeding motor neuron activity.},

The N2v --{$>$} B3 motor neuron excitatory synaptic response could be mimicked by focal or bath application of -glutamate at concentrations of {$>$}/=10(-3) M. Quisqualate and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) were potent agonists for the B3 excitatory glutamate receptor (10(-3) M), whereas kainate only produced very weak responses at the same concentration. This suggested that non-N-methyl--aspartate (NMDA), AMPA/quisqualate receptors were present on the B3 cell. The specific non-NMDA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX; 10(-5) M) blocked 85\% of the excitatory effects on the B3 cell produced by focal application of glutamate (10(-3) M), confirming the presence of non-NMDA receptors. CNQX also blocked the major part of the excitatory postsynaptic potentials on the B3 cell produced by spontaneous or current-evoked bursts of spikes in the N2v cell. As with focal application of glutamate, a small delayed component remained that was CNQX insensitive. This provided direct evidence that glutamate acting via receptors of the non-NMDA, AMPA/quisqualate type were responsible for mediating the main N2v --{$>$} B3 cell excitatory response. NMDA at 10(-2) M also excited the B3 cell, but the effects were much more variable in size and absent in one-third of the 25 B3 cells tested. NMDA effects on B3 cells were not enhanced by bath application of glycine at 10(-4) M or reduction of Mg2+ concentration in the saline to zero, suggesting the absence of typical NMDA receptors. The variability of the B3 cell responses to NMDA suggested these receptors were unlikely to be the main receptor type involved with N2v --{$>$} B3 excitation. Quisqualate and AMPA at 10(-3) M also mimicked N2v inhibitory effects on the B7 and B8 feeding motor neurons and the modulatory slow oscillator (SO) interneuron, providing further evidence for the role of AMPA/quisqualate receptors. Similar effects were seen with glutamate at the same concentration. However, CNQX could not block either glutamate or N2v inhibitory postsynaptic responses on the B7, B8, or SO cells, suggesting a different glutamate receptor subtype for inhibitory responses compared with those responsible for N2v --{$>$} B3 excitation. We conclude that glutamate is a strong candidate transmitter for the N2v cells and that AMPA/quisquate receptors of different subtypes are likely to be responsible for the excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic responses.},

Glutamatergic N2v cells are central pattern generator interneurons of the Lymnaea feeding system: new model for rhythm generation. J. Neurophysiol. 78: 3396--3407, 1997. We aimed to show that the paired N2v (N2 ventral) plateauing cells of the buccal ganglia are important central pattern generator (CPG) interneurons of the Lymnaea feeding system. N2v plateauing is phase-locked to the rest of the CPG network in a slow oscillator (SO)-driven fictive feeding rhythm. The phase of the rhythm is reset by artificially evoked N2v bursts, a characteristic of CPG neurons. N2v cells have extensive input and output synaptic connections with the rest of the CPG network and the modulatory SO cell and cerebral giant cells (CGCs). Synaptic input from the protraction phase interneurons N1M (excitatory), N1L (inhibitory), and SO (inhibitory-excitatory) are likely to contribute to a ramp-shaped prepotential that triggers the N2v plateau. The prepotential has a highly complex waveform due to progressive changes in the amplitude of the component synaptic potentials. Most significant is the facilitation of the excitatory component of the SO {$\rightarrow$} N2v monosynaptic connection. None of the other CPG interneurons has the appropriate input synaptic connections to terminate the N2v plateaus. The modulatory function of acetylcholine (ACh), the transmitter of the SO and N1M/N1Ls, was examined. Focal application of ACh (50-ms pulses) onto the N2v cells reproduced the SO {$\rightarrow$} N2v biphasic synaptic response but also induced long-term plateauing (20--60 s). N2d cells show no endogenous ability to plateau, but this can be induced by focal applications of ACh. The N2v cells inhibit the N3 tonic (N3t) but not the N3 phasic (N3p) CPG interneurons. The N2v {$\rightarrow$} N3t inhibitory synaptic connection is important in timing N3t activity. The N3t cells recover from this inhibition and fire during the swallow phase of the feeding pattern. Feedback N2v inhibition to the SO, N1L protraction phase interneurons prevents them firing during the retraction phase of the feeding cycle. The N2v {$\rightarrow$} N1M synaptic connection was weak and only found in 50\% of preparations. A weak N2v {$\rightarrow$} CGC inhibitory connection prevents the CGCs firing during the rasp (N2) phase of the feeding cycle. These data allowed a new model for the Lymnaea feeding CPG to be proposed. This emphasizes that each of the six types of CPG interneuron has a unique set of synaptic connections, all of which contribute to the generation of a full CPG pattern.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Objective. Infrared light can be used to modulate the activity of neuronal cells through thermally-evoked capacitive currents and thermosensitive ion channel modulation. The infrared power threshold for action potentials has previously been found to be far lower in the in vivo cochlea when compared with other neuronal targets, implicating spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) as a potential target for infrared auditory prostheses. However, conflicting experimental evidence suggests that this low threshold may arise from an intermediary mechanism other than direct SGN stimulation, potentially involving residual hair cell activity. Approach. Patch-clamp recordings from cultured SGNs were used to explicitly quantify the capacitive and ion channel currents in an environment devoid of hair cells. Neurons were irradiated by a 1870 nm laser with pulse durations of 0.2-5.0 ms and powers up to 1.5 W. A Hodgkin-Huxley-type model was established by first characterising the voltage dependent currents, and then incorporating laser-evoked currents separated into temperature-dependent and temperature-gradient-dependent components. This model was found to accurately simulate neuronal responses and allowed the results to be extrapolated to stimulation parameter spaces not accessible during this study. Main results. The previously-reported low in vivo SGN stimulation threshold was not observed, and only subthreshold depolarisation was achieved, even at high light exposures. Extrapolating these results with our Hodgkin-Huxley-type model predicts an action potential threshold which does not deviate significantly from other neuronal types. Significance. This suggests that the low-threshold response that is commonly reported in vivo may arise from an alternative mechanism, and calls into question the potential usefulness of the effect for auditory prostheses. The step-wise approach to modelling optically-evoked currents described here may prove useful for analysing a wider range of cell types where capacitive currents and conductance modulation are dominant.},

The laser exposure poses a moderate risk of thermal damage to the target neuron. Indeed, exogenous methods of neural stimulation often place the target neurons under stressful non-physiological conditions, which can hinder ordinary neuronal function and hasten cell death. Therefore, quantifying the exposure-dependent probability of neuronal damage is essential for identifying safe operating limits of INS and other interventions for therapeutic and prosthetic use. Using patch-clamp recordings in isolated spiral ganglion neurons, we describe a method for determining the dose-dependent damage probabilities of individual neurons in response to both acute and cumulative infrared exposure parameters based on changes in injection current. The results identify a local thermal damage threshold at approximately 60 \&\#x00B0;C, which is in keeping with previous literature and supports the claim that damage during INS is a purely thermal phenomenon. In principle this method can be applied to any potentially injurious stimuli, allowing for the calculation of a wide range of dose-dependent neural damage probabilities. Unlike histological analyses, the technique is well-suited to quantifying gradual neuronal damage, and critical threshold behaviour is not required.},

Although other neuronal properties such as paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and slow PSPs are well characterized, their role in information processing remains unclear. It is possible that these properties contribute to temporal processing in the range of hundreds of milliseconds, a range relevant to most complex sensory processing. A continuous-time neural network model based on integrate-and-fire elements that incorporate PPF and slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) was developed here. The time constants of the PPF and IPSPs were estimated from empirical data and were identical and constant for all elements in the circuit. When these elements were incorporated into a circuit inspired by neocortical connectivity, the network was able to discriminate different temporal patterns. Generalization emerged spontaneously. These results demonstrate that known time-dependent neuronal properties enable a network to transform temporal information into a spatial code in a self-organizing manner--that is, with no need to assume a spectrum of time delays or to custom-design the circuit.},

Moreover, neuromodulators control the activity of these proteins through G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling cascades. Here, we review cellular mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in axonal ion channel neuromodulation and examine how changes to ion channel function affect AP initiation, AP propagation, and the release of neurotransmitter. We then examine how these mechanisms could modulate synaptic function by focusing on three key features of synaptic information transmission: synaptic strength, synaptic variability, and short-term plasticity. Viewing these cellular mechanisms of neuromodulation from a functional perspective may assist in extending these findings to theories of neural circuit function and its neuromodulation.},

The recently acquired data address three conceptual areas: the generalized motor program (GMP), intermanual crosstalk and dynamic systems models. To varying degrees, each of these concepts has aspects that can be reconciled with experimental evidence. The idea of a GMP is supported by the demonstration of abstract neuronal motor codes, e.g. bimanual-specific activity in motor cortex. The crosstalk model is consistent with the facts that hand-specific coding also exists and that interactions occur between the motor commands for each arm. Uncrossed efferent projections may underlie crosstalk on an executional level. Dynamic interhemispheric interactions through the corpus callosum may provide a high-level link at the parametric programming level, allowing flexible coupling and de-coupling. Flexible neuronal interactions could also underlie adaptive large-scale systems dynamics that can be formalized within the dynamic systems theory approach. The correspondence of identified neuronal processes with functions of abstract models encourages the development of realistic computational models that can predict bimanual behavior on the basis of neuronal activity.},

With these advantages INS has the potential to increase our understanding of specific neural pathways and impact current diagnostic and therapeutic clinical applications. In order to develop this technique, we investigate the feasibility of INS ({$\lambda$} = 1.875. {$\mu$}m, fiber diameter = 100-400. {$\mu$}m) to activate and modulate neural activity in primary visual cortex (V1) of Macaque monkeys. Infrared neural stimulation was found to evoke localized neural responses as evidenced by both electrophysiology and intrinsic signal optical imaging (OIS). Single unit recordings acquired during INS indicated statistically significant increases in neuron firing rates that demonstrate INS evoked excitatory neural activity. Consistent with this, INS stimulation led to focal intensity-dependent reflectance changes recorded with OIS. We also asked whether INS is capable of stimulating functionally specific domains in visual cortex and of modulating visually evoked activity in visual cortex. We found that application of INS via 100. {$\mu$}m or 200. {$\mu$}m fiber optics produced enhancement of visually evoked OIS response confined to the eye column where INS was applied and relative suppression of the other eye column. Stimulating the cortex with a 400. {$\mu$}m fiber, exceeding the ocular dominance width, led to relative suppression, consistent with involvement of inhibitory surrounds. This study is the first to demonstrate that INS can be used to either enhance or diminish visual cortical response and that this can be done in a functional domain specific manner. INS thus holds great potential for use as a safe, non-contact, focally specific brain stimulation technology in primate brains. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Marr-Albus theory postulates that such networks separate overlapping activity patterns by mapping them onto larger numbers of sparsely active neurons. But spatial correlations in synaptic input and those introduced by network connectivity are likely to compromise performance. To investigate the structural and functional determinants of pattern separation we built models of the cerebellar input layer with spatially correlated input patterns, and systematically varied their synaptic connectivity. Performance was quantified by the learning speed of a classifier trained on either the input or output patterns. Our results show that sparse synaptic connectivity is essential for separating spatially correlated input patterns over a wide range of network activity, and that expansion and correlations, rather than sparse activity, are the major determinants of pattern separation. {\copyright} 2017 The Author(s).},

In the past few years, several strategies have arisen that allow light to control ion channels and therefore neuronal function. Light-based triggers for ion channel control include caged compounds, which release active neurotransmitters when photolyzed with light, and natural photoreceptive proteins, which can be expressed exogenously in neurons. More recently, a third type of light trigger has been introduced: a photoisomerizable tethered ligand that directly controls ion channel activity in a light-dependent manner. Beyond the experimental applications for light-gated ion channels, there may be clinical applications in which these light-sensitive ion channels could prove advantageous over traditional methods. Electrodes for neural stimulation to control disease symptoms are invasive and often difficult to reposition between cells in tissue. Stimulation by chemical agents is difficult to constrain to individual cells and has limited temporal accuracy in tissue due to diffusional limitations. In contrast, ion channels that can be directly activated with light allow control with unparalleled spatial and temporal precision. The goal of this chapter is to describe light-regulated ion channels and how they have been tailored to control different aspects of neural activity, and how to use these channels to manipulate and better understand development, function, and plasticity of neurons and neural circuits.},

The adenovirus may concentrate in a specific neural region. By shining light on the target nerve region, the photosensitive protein encoded by the adenovirus is controlled. Photosensitive proteins controlled by light can selectively allow ions inside and outside the cell membrane to pass through, resulting in inhibition or activation effects. Due to the precision and minimally invasive, optogenetics has achieved good results in many fields, especially in the field of neuron functions and neural circuits. Significant advances have also been made in the study of many clinical diseases. This review focuses on the research of optogenetics in the field of neurobiology. These include how to use optogenetics to control nerve cells, study neural circuits, and treat diseases by changing the state of neurons. We hoped that this review will give a comprehensive understanding of the progress of optogenetics in the field of neurobiology.},

  abstract = {The traditional approach to modulating brain function (in both clinical and basic science applications) is to tap into the neural circuitry using electrical currents applied via implanted electrodes. However, it suffers from a number of problems, including the risk of tissue trauma, poor spatial specificity, and the inability to selectively stimulate neuronal subtypes. About a decade ago, optical alternatives to electrical stimulation started to emerge in order to address the shortcomings of electrical stimulation. We describe the use of one optical stimulation technique, infrared neural stimulation (INS), during which short (of the order of a millisecond) pulses of infrared light are delivered to the neural tissue. Very focal stimulation is achieved via a thermal mechanism and stimulation location can be quickly adjusted by redirecting the light. After describing some of the work done in the peripheral nervous system, we focus on the use of INS in the central nervous system to investigate functional connectivity in the visual and somatosensory areas, target specific functional domains, and influence behavior of an awake nonhuman primate. We conclude with a positive outlook for INS as a tool for safe and precise targeted brain stimulation.},

Serious consideration must be given to the ease with which the nervous system selected is amenable to study by cellular techniques. For this reason, most of the results presented in this book deal primarily with the stomatogastric nervous system and are not devoted to a detailed consideration of the motor functions of the crustacean foregut, per se. However, these results cannot be appreciated without a minimal knowledge of the anatomy of the neuromuscular systems in the foregut and cannot be put into a biological perspective if they do not explain the motor behavior. The goal of this first chapter is: (1) to describe the basic structure of the foregut and the anatomical organization of the muscles and neurons involved in its operation, and (2) to examine the possible range of motor behavior expressed by each region of the foregut in the intact animal.},

Depressive disorder was the most commonly cited diagnosis, followed by bipolar affective disorder. Six themes emerged from the thematic analysis: treatment resistance, side-effects of other treatments, desperation for relief, proactively seeking information, long-term illness and illness getting worse. Clinical implications TMS has recently been recommended in the UK for routine use in clinical practice. Therefore, the number of people who self-refer for TMS treatment is likely to increase as its availability increases. Declaration of interest None.},

  abstract = {Stop-flow techniques were used to determine how temperature affected the axonal transport of dopamine-{$\beta$}-hydroxylase (DBH) activity in rabbit sciatic nerves in vitro. These nerves were cooled locally to 2{$^\circ$}C for 1.5 hr, which caused a sharp peak of DBH activity to accumulate above the cooled region. Accumulated DBH was then allowed to resume migration at various temperatures. From direct measurements of the rate of migration, we found that the axonal transport velocity of DBH was a simple exponential function of temperature between 13{$^\circ$}C and 42{$^\circ$}C. Over this range of temperatures, the results were well described by the equation: V = 0.546(1.09)T, where V is velocity in mm/hr, and T is temperature in degrees centigrade. The Q10 between 13{$^\circ$}C and 42{$^\circ$}C was 2.33, and an Arrhenius plot of the natural logarithm of velocity versus the reciprocal of absolute temperature yielded an apparent activation energy of 14.8 kcal. Transport virtually halted when temperature was raised to 47{$^\circ$}C, although only about half of the DBH activity disappeared during incubation at this temperature. Another transition occurred at 13{$^\circ$}C; below this temperature, velocity fell precipitously. This was not an artifact peculiar to the stop-flow system since the rate of accumulation of DBH activity proximal to a cold-block also decreased abruptly when the temperature above the block was reduced below 13{$^\circ$}C.},

  abstract = {Synchronous spiking during cerebellar tasks has been observed across Purkinje cells: however, little is known about the intrinsic cellular mechanisms responsible for its initiation, cessation and stability. The Phase Response Curve (PRC), a simple input-output characterization of single cells, can provide insights into individual and collective properties of neurons and networks, by quantifying the impact of an infinitesimal depolarizing current pulse on the time of occurrence of subsequent action potentials, while a neuron is firing tonically. Recently, the PRC theory applied to cerebellar Purkinje cells revealed that these behave as phase-independent integrators at low firing rates, and switch to a phase-dependent mode at high rates. Given the implications for computation and information processing in the cerebellum and the possible role of synchrony in the communication with its post-synaptic targets, we further explored the firing rate dependency of the PRC in Purkinje cells. We isolated key factors for the experimental estimation of the PRC and developed a closed-loop approach to reliably compute the PRC across diverse firing rates in the same cell. Our results show unambiguously that the PRC of individual Purkinje cells is firing rate dependent and that it smoothly transitions from phase independent integrator to a phase dependent mode. Using computational models we show that neither channel noise nor a realistic cell morphology are responsible for the rate dependent shift in the phase response curve.},

How the nervous system uses these graded perceptual shifts to select between opposed motor patterns remains enigmatic. Here, we challenged food-deprived and satiated Lymnaea to choose between two mutually exclusive behaviors, ingestion or egestion, produced by the same feeding central pattern generator. Decoding the underlying neural circuit reveals that the activity of central dopaminergic interneurons defines hunger state and drives network reconfiguration, biasing satiated animals toward the rejection of stimuli deemed palatable by food-deprived ones. By blocking the action of these neurons, satiated animals can be reconfigured to exhibit a hungry animal phenotype. This centralized mechanism occurs in the complete absence of sensory retuning and generalizes across different sensory modalities, allowing food-deprived animals to increase their perception of food value in a stimulus-independent manner to maximize potential calorific intake.},

  abstract = {Interference-based forgetting occurs when new information acquired either before or after a learning event attenuates memory expression (proactive and retroactive interference, respectively). Multiple learning events often occur in rapid succession, leading to competition between consolidating memories. However, it is unknown what factors determine which memory is remembered or forgotten. Here, we challenge the snail, Lymnaea, to acquire two consecutive similar or different memories and identify learning-induced changes in neurons of its well-characterized motor circuits. We show that when new learning takes place during a stable period of the original memory, proactive interference only occurs if the two consolidating memories engage the same circuit mechanisms. If different circuits are used, both memories survive. However, any new learning during a labile period of consolidation promotes retroactive interference and the acquisition of the new memory. Therefore, the effect of interference depends both on the timing of new learning and the underlying neuronal mechanisms. Michael Crossley et al. use the snail Lymnaea to investigate the factors involved in determining which memories are remembered or forgotten when multiple learning events happen close together. They find that timing of events and whether the same neuronal mechanisms are used are key factors in determining whether interference will occur.},

  abstract = {Objective. To design and implement a setup for ex-vivo optical stimulation for exploring the effect of several key parameters (optical power and pulse duration), activation features (threshold, spatial selectivity) and recovery characteristics (repeated stimuli) in peripheral nerves. Approach. A nerve chamber allowing ex-vivo electrical and optical stimulation was designed and built. A 1470 nm light source was chosen to stimulate the nerve. A photodiode module was implemented for synchronization of the electrical and optical channels. Main results. Compound neural action potentials (CNAPs) were successfully generated with infrared light pulses of 200-2000 {\textmu}s duration and power in the range of 3-10 W. These parameters determine a radiant exposure for stimulation in the range 1.59-4.78 J cm-2. Recruitment curves were obtained by increasing durations at a constant power level. Neural activation threshold is reached at a mean radiant exposure of 3.16 0.68 J cm-2 and mean pulse energy of 3.79 0.72 mJ. Repetition rates of 2-10 Hz have been explored. In eight out of ten sciatic nerves (SNs), repeated light stimuli induced a sensitization effect in that the CNAP amplitude progressively grows, representing an increasing number of recruited fibres. In two out of ten SNs, CNAPs were composed of a succession of peaks corresponding to different conduction velocities. Significance. The reported sensitization effect could shed light on the mechanism underlying infrared neurostimulation. Our results suggest that, in sharp contrast with electrical stimuli, optical pulses could recruit slow fibres early on. This more physiological order of recruitment opens the perspective for specific neuromodulation of fibre population who remained poorly accessible until now. Short high-power light pulses at wavelengths below 1.5 {\textmu}m offer interesting perspectives for neurostimulation.},

Both systems can be expensive to install and use. We have developed a low cost, wireless optogenetic probe, CerebraLux, built from off-the-shelf components.

The optical component (0.5 g) is mounted on the head permanently, whereas the electronic component (2.3 g) is removable and is applied for each experiment. We describe the device, provide all designs and specifications, the methods to manufacture and use the device in vivo, and demonstrate feasibility in a mouse behavioral paradigm.},

  abstract = {Santiago Ram{\'o}n y Cajal was still young when he came across the reazione nera, discovered by the Italian Camillo Golgi. Cajal became absolutely entranced by the fine structure of the nervous system this technique revealed, which led him to embark on one of the last truly epic endeavors in Modern History: the characterization of nervous cells, and of their organization to form the brain. Cajal remained in Spain throughout his scientific career, working for years alone. With international recognition, Cajal began recruiting brilliant students as collaborators. A handful of his pupils also made decisive discoveries that served to lay the foundations of modern Neuroscience. Cajal's brother Pedro, Tello, Domingo S{\'a}nchez, Ach{\'u}carro, Lafora, R{\'i}o-Hortega, de Castro and Lorente de N{\'o} worked side by side with El Maestro. While Cajal himself pronounced some of the basic rules that have helped us to understand the nervous system (the neuron theory, the law of dynamic polarization of the neuron), as well as providing innumerable details about the histological organization of the different neural structures, it was P{\'i}o del R{\'i}o-Hortega who identified two of the four main cell types in the CNS (oligodendrocytes and microglia), and Fernando de Castro who described the innervation of the blood vessels and identified the first chemoreceptors in the carotid body. Together, this group of scientists is known as the Spanish Neurological School, and if they had not existed, the History of Neuroscience would surely have been quite a different story; and proof that Cajal was a truly exceptional scientist but he was not an exception for Spanish Science.},

We can now pin down the neurons that fire when a person reports becoming aware of a piece of information and understand the crucial role unconscious computations play in how we make decisions. The emerging theory enables a test of consciousness in animals, babies, and those with severe brain injuries.

His basic concepts on the neuron as the main building block of the central nervous system, the dynamic polarization principle as a way to understand how neurons deal with ongoing active processes, and brain local structural arrangements as a result of the functional specialization of selected neural circuits are concepts still surviving in present research papers dealing with brain function during the performance of cognitive and/or behavioral activities. What is more, the central dogma of the Neuroscience of today, i.e., brain plasticity as the morpho-functional substrate of memory and learning processes, was already proposed and documented with notable insights by Ram{\'o}n y Cajal.

Recordings were made from primary afferent fibers in the rat sciatic nerve and second order somatosensory cells in the dorsal horn. Most of the laser-sensitive afferent fibers sampled were C polymodal nociceptors with lesser representation of other thermoreceptor types. There were no instances in which low threshold mechanoreceptors or other nonthermal afferent fibers were engaged.

An electrical train of stimuli applied over the second lumbar segment with a frequency of 25 to 60 Hz and an amplitude of 5-9 V was effective in inducing rhythmic, alternating stance and swing phases of the lower limbs.

We show that the speech modulation spectrum is highly consistent across 9 languages (including languages with typologically different rhythmic characteristics). A different, but similarly consistent modulation spectrum is observed for music, including classical music played by single instruments of different types, symphonic, jazz, and rock. The temporal modulations of speech and music show broad but well-separated peaks around 5 and 2 Hz, respectively. These acoustically dominant time scales may be intrinsic features of speech and music, a possibility which should be investigated using more culturally diverse samples in each domain. Distinct modulation timescales for speech and music could facilitate their perceptual analysis and its neural processing.},

Attention bias modification (ABM) is a cognitive intervention designed to improve depression by decreasing negative attentional bias, but to date its efficacy has been inconclusive. Adjunctive neuroenhancement to augment clinical effectiveness has shown promise, particularly for individuals who respond positively to the primary intervention. Objective/hypothesis This randomized, sham-controlled proof-of-principle study is the first to test the hypothesis that augmentative LLLT will improve the effects of ABM among adults with elevated symptoms of depression. Methods Fifty-one adult participants with elevated symptoms of depression received ABM before and after laser stimulation and were randomized to one of three conditions: right forehead, left forehead, or sham. Participants repeated LLLT two days later and were assessed for depression symptoms one and two weeks later. Results A significant three-way interaction between LLLT condition, ABM response, and time indicated that right LLLT led to greater symptom improvement among participants whose attention was responsive to ABM (i.e., attention was directed away from negative stimuli). Minimal change in depression was observed in the left and sham LLLT. Conclusions The beneficial effects of ABM on depression symptoms may be enhanced when paired with adjunctive interventions such as right prefrontal LLLT; however, cognitive response to ABM likely moderates the impact of neuroenhancement. The results suggest that larger clinical trials examining the efficacy of using photoneuromodulation to augment cognitive training are warranted.},

  abstract = {Neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to investigate mechanisms underlying transient changes in intracellular free Ca 2+ concentration ([Ca 2+] i) evoked by pulsed infrared radiation (IR, 1862 nm). Fluorescence confocal microscopy revealed IR-evoked [Ca 2+] i events with each IR pulse (3-4 ms pulse -1, 9.1-11.6 J cm -2 pulse -1). IR-evoked [Ca 2+] i events were distinct from the relatively large spontaneous [Ca 2+] i transients, with IR-evoked events exhibiting smaller amplitudes (0.88 {$\Delta$}F/F 0vs. 1.99 {$\Delta$}F/F 0) and shorter time constants ({$\tau$}= 0.64 s vs. 1.19 s, respectively). Both IR-evoked [Ca 2+] i events and spontaneous [Ca 2+] i transients could be entrained by the IR pulse (0.2-1 pulse s -1), provided the IR dose was sufficient and the radiation was applied directly to the cell. Examination of IR-evoked events during peak spontaneous [Ca 2+] i periods revealed a rapid drop in [Ca 2+] i, often restoring the baseline [Ca 2+] i concentration, followed by a transient increase in [Ca 2+] i. Cardiomyocytes were challenged with pharmacological agents to examine potential contributors to the IR-evoked [Ca 2+] i events. Three compounds proved to be the most potent, reversible inhibitors: (1) CGP-37157 (20 {$\mu$}m, n= 12), an inhibitor of the mitochondrial Na +/Ca 2+ exchanger (mNCX), (2) Ruthenium Red (40 {$\mu$}m, n= 13), an inhibitor of the mitochondrial Ca 2+ uniporter (mCU), and (3) 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane (10 {$\mu$}m, n= 6), an IP 3 channel antagonist. Ryanodine blocked the spontaneous [Ca 2+] i transients but did not alter the IR-evoked events in the same cells. This pharmacological array implicates mitochondria as the major intracellular store of Ca 2+ involved in IR-evoked responses reported here. Results support the hypothesis that 1862 nm pulsed IR modulates mitochondrial Ca 2+ transport primarily through actions on mCU and mNCX. {\copyright} 2011 The Authors.

  abstract = {Analysis and control of neural circuitry requires the ability to selectively activate or inhibit neurons. Previous work showed that infrared laser light selectively excited neural activity in endogenous unmyelinated and myelinated axons. However, inhibition of neuronal firing with infrared light was only observed in limited cases, is not well understood and was not precisely controlled. Using an experimentally tractable unmyelinated preparation for detailed investigation and a myelinated preparation for validation, we report that it is possible to selectively and transiently inhibit electrically-initiated axonal activation, as well as to both block or enhance the propagation of action potentials of specific motor neurons. Thus, in addition to previously shown excitation, we demonstrate an optical method of suppressing components of the nervous system with functional spatiotemporal precision. We believe this technique is well-suited for non-invasive investigations of diverse excitable tissues and may ultimately be applied for treating neurological disorders. A long with further elucidation of mechanisms underlying neural function, burgeoning interest in deep brain stimulation 1 , pain management 2 , functional electrical stimulation 3 , and brain-computer interfaces 4 have created a demand for higher levels of neural specificity and control. Advances in electrical neural interface design have overcome many technical and biological challenges required to successfully excite and inhibit neural structures 5,6. Additionally, novel optical methods of spatially and temporally precise neural control are increasing in popularity 7,8. Optogenetics, a technique whereby light-responsive ion channels are introduced into targeted cells, is a promising new technology for exciting and inhibiting small groups of neurons with high spatial and temporal precision 7. Recently, this technique was also used to inhibit motor nerve and muscle activity in transgenic mice 9. While an excellent tool for preclinical discovery, optogenetics is currently unavailable for clinical use due to the need for genetic manipulation. In this work, we demonstrate the utility of an alternative optical technique for neural control using pulses of infrared light. The capability of pulsed infrared light to provide precise spatiotemporal activation of diverse excitable tissues has been shown 10-18. In addition to neural excitation, we recently observed instances of suppressed activity in response to infrared light, though the mechanisms of action were unclear 13,19. The response was reliable, repeatable, and occurred at a higher range of radiant energies than those used to induce excitation 19. Recently, in the toadfish, it was demonstrated that spontaneous activity of sensory neurons innervating the vestibular system could be excited or inhibited by infrared light 20. An attractive attribute of thermal neuromodulation, such as infrared neural stimulation, is the ability to both activate and suppress neural activity. Infrared-induced activation is believed to be the result of a brief (,ms) spatiotemporal gradient (dT/dt and dT/dx) 15,18 , whereas suppression is a function of an increase in baseline temperature (DT). By changing laser parameters (e.g. pulse width and frequency), one can either produce large, brief temperature transients for stimulation or relatively smaller temperature increases for suppression. While the discovery of controlled neural activation with infrared light was recently described, global temperature changes leading to block of nerve conduction, a phenomenon known as ''heat block'', has been investigated in both unmyelinated and myelinated nerves for decades 21,22. Recent modeling studies also indicate the potential for block of action potential (AP) initiation and propagation with local increases in nerve temperature 23. Here we demonstrate the use of infrared pulses to transiently suppress electrically initiated AP generation and propagation, as well as neuromuscular function with high spatiotemporal specificity relative to currently available means of functional neural control. This effect was repeatedly demonstrated in both the unmyelinated buccal nerve 2 (BN2) of Aplysia californica, where it was used to inhibit specific sub-populations of the motor axons OPEN SUBJECT AREAS: BIOTECHNOLOGY MOTOR CONTROL PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM INHIBITION},

We have used the lucifer yellow photoinactivation technique to separate the connections made by the PD motor neurons from those made by the AB interneuron. 2. Photoinactivation of either the two PD neurons or the single AB neuron allowed us to separate the compound inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in the lateral pyloric (LP) and pyloric (PY) motor neurons resulting from synchronous PD and AB activity into AB-evoked and PD-evoked components. These IPSPs have different time courses, reversal potentials, ion selectivities, and pharmacological properties. 3. Photoinactivation and membrane-potential manipulations indicated that a readily observable IPSP recorded in the AB neuron and correlated with action potentials in the LP neuron is actually an electrotonic potential due to an LP-evoked IPSP in the PD neurons. 4. Selective inactivation of either the two PD neurons or the AB neuron revealed that the IPSP recorded in the ventricular dilator (VD) motor neuron is due solely to AB-released transmitter. 5. The electrical coupling potentials measurable between the AB, PD, and VD neuron somata are due to direct electrical coupling between all of these neurons. 6. Circuit analysis and transmitter identification may be complicated by electrical coupling. We suggest that the presence of electrical coupling between nonidentical neurons may provide a new mechanism that allows changes in synaptic characteristics among neurons within a "hard-wired" circuit.}

These enzymes are widely assumed to also have unique rate--temperature dependencies. Thermophilic enzymes, for example, are considered optimal at high temperatures and effectively inactive at low temperatures due to excess rigidity. Surveying published data, we find that thermophilic, mesophilic, and psychrophilic enzymes exhibit indistinguishable rate--temperature dependencies. Furthermore, given the nonenzymatic rate--temperature dependency, all enzymes, regardless of their operation temperatures, become {\textbackslash}textgreater10-fold less powerful catalysts per 25{$^\circ$}C temperature increase. Among other factors, this loss of rate acceleration may be ascribed to thermally induced vibrations compromising the active-site catalytic configuration, suggesting that many enzymes are in fact insufficiently rigid.},

  abstract = {Central Pattern Generator (CPG) circuits are neural networks that generate rhythmic motor patterns. These circuits are typically built of half-center oscillator subcircuits with reciprocally inhibitory connections. Another common property in many CPGs is the remarkable rich spiking-bursting dynamics of their constituent cells, which balance robustness and flexibility to generate their joint coordinated rhythms. In this paper, we use conductance-based models and realistic connection topologies inspired by the crustacean pyloric CPG to address the study of asymmetry factors shaping CPG bursting rhythms. In particular, we assess the role of asymmetric maximal synaptic conductances, time constants and gap-junction connectivity to establish the regularity of half-center oscillator based CPGs. We map and characterize the synaptic parameter space that lead to regular and irregular bursting activity in these networks. The analysis indicates that asymmetric configurations display robust regular rhythms and that large regions of both regular and irregular but coordinated rhythms exist as a function of the asymmetry in the circuit. Our results show that asymmetry both in the maximal conductances and in the temporal dynamics of mutually inhibitory neurons can synergistically contribute to shape wide regimes of regular spiking-bursting activity in central pattern generators. Finally, we discuss how a closed-loop protocol driven by a regularity goal can be used to find and characterize regular regimes when there is not time to perform an exhaustive search, as in most experimental studies.},

Many central pattern generators (CPGs) are built on a basic circuit of reciprocally inhibitory neurons, the minimal configuration that can produce distinct rhythmic patterns for controlling antagonistic muscles. In this paper, we use a closed-loop to control the rhythm of a CPG model based on this minimal network architecture. The closed-loop adapts the maximum conductance of the inhibition to achieve a regularized rhythm departing from an otherwise highly irregular spiking-bursting activity. Our results show that the closed-loop conductance control can rapidly find the best connectivity that leads to the regularization goal. We also discuss several external stimuli that lead to regularized CPG rhythms. We argue that the proposed closed-loop approach can be used to control CPG rhythms in a wide variety of applications in experimental and theoretical research.},

The level of irregularity and coordination was characterized using intrinsic time references and intervals in long recordings of the pyloric central pattern generator. The analysis demonstrated strong robustness of transient dynamics in keeping not only the activation sequences but also specific cycle-by-cycle temporal relationships in the form of dynamical invariants. The rich dynamics of neurons and connections balance flexibility and coordination to readily negotiate the interactions between neurons and produce the resultant rhythm. In particular, two dynamical invariants were identified between time intervals that build the sequence, existing even outside steady states. We suggest that invariant temporal sequence relationships could be present in other networks, including those related to brain rhythms, and underlie rhythm programming and functionality.},

The SO is an interneuron whose axon branches solely within the buccal ganglia. There is only one such cell in each snail. In half the snails the cell body is in the right buccal ganglion and in the other half in the left buccal ganglion. Stimulation of either the SO or one of the N1 pattern-generating interneurons elicits the feeding rhythm, but of all the buccal neurons, only the SO can drive the feeding rhythm at the frequency seen in the intact snail. The SO makes reciprocal excitatory synapses with the N1 interneurons that drive the protraction of the radula. This ensures strong activation of the feeding system. The SO inhibits the N2 interneurons. Postsynaptic potentials evoked by stimulation of the SO facilitate without spike broadening in the SO. The SO is strongly inhibited by N2 and N3 interneurons, which are active during the retraction phase. This gates any excitatory inputs to the SO, probably preventing protraction of the radula while retraction is underway. The results support the idea of a single interneuron capable of driving a hierarchically organized motor system.},

  abstract = {Intracellular recordings were made from rhythm-generating interneurons in the Lymnaea feeding system. The feeding pattern is a three-phase rhythm of interneuronal activity (N1, N2, N3) corresponding to protraction, rasp, and swallow. We describe the firing pattern and anatomy of the premotor interneurons, each of which fires a predominant burst in only one phase of the feeding rhythm. The rhythm can be driven by steady depolarization of N1 cells. The phase of the rhythm is reset by brief stimulation of N2 or N3 interneurons. N1 neurons excite the N2 interneurons, and these in turn inhibit the N1 cells. This recurrent inhibitory pathway can account for the switch from the N1 phase of the feeding cycles to the N2 phase. The endogenous properties of the N2 interneurons are apparently responsible for the termination of N2 bursts. N3 interneurons display postinhibitory rebound (PIR), and this probably contributes to their burst after the end of the N2 inhibitory input. N2 and N3 interneurons inhibit the N1 cells. When the N3 burst dies away, activity in N1 cells resumes under the stimulus of depolarizing current. Interactions between interneurons are mainly by discrete, monophasic postsynaptic potentials, that follow 1:1. They have relatively short latency (2-12 ms) and duration (up to 100 ms). The synaptic connections between the three types of premotor interneurons are sufficient to account for the sequence of activity seen during feeding.},

Among various optical techniques, infrared neural stimulation has been effective via a thermal mechanism enabling focused and noninvasive stimulation without any genetic manipulation, but it results in bulk heating of neural tissue. Recently, it has been shown that neural cells can be activated more efficiently by pulsed near-infrared (NIR) light delivered to gold nanorods (GNRs) near the neural cells. Despite its potential, however, the biophysical mechanism underlying this GNR-enhanced NIR stimulation has not been clearly explained yet. Here, we propose an integrative and quantitative model to elucidate the mechanism by modeling heat generated from interaction between NIR light and GNRs, the temperature-dependent ion channels (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1; TRPV1) in the neuronal membrane, and a heat-induced capacitive current through the membrane. Our results show that NIR pulses induce abrupt temperature elevation near the neuronal membrane and lead to both the TRPV1-channel and capacitive currents. Both current sources synergistically increase the membrane potential and elicit an action potential, and which mechanism is dominant depends on conditions such as the laser pulse duration and TRPV1 channel density. Although the TRPV1 mechanism dominates in most cases we tested, the capacitive current makes a larger contribution when a very short laser pulse is illuminated on neural cells with relatively low TRPV1 channel densities.},

Here, we demonstrate rapid, robust and reproducible repeated activation of snake TRPA1 channels heterologously expressed in non-neuronal cells, mouse neurons and zebrafish neurons in vivo by infrared (IR) laser radiation. A fibre-optic probe that integrates a nitrogen {\`A} vacancy (NV) diamond quantum sensor with optical and microwave waveguide delivery enables thermometry with single-cell resolution, allowing neurons to be activated by exceptionally mild heating, thus preventing the damaging effects of excessive heat. The neuronal responses to the activation by IR laser radiation are fully characterized using Ca 2 {\th} imaging and electrophysiology, providing, for the first time, a complete framework for a thermogenetic manipulation of individual neurons using IR light.},

  abstract = {The coupling of high frequency oscillations (HFOs; \&gt;100 Hz) and theta oscillations (3-12 Hz) in the CA1 region of rats increases during REM sleep, indicating that it may play a role in memory processing. However, it is unclear whether the CA1 region itself is capable of providing major contributions to the generation of HFOs, or if they are strictly driven through input projections. Parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons may play an essential role in these oscillations due to their extensive connections with neighbouring pyramidal cells, and their characteristic fast-spiking. Thus, we created mathematical network models to investigate the conditions under which networks of CA1 fast-spiking PV+ interneurons are capable of producing high frequency population rhythms. We used whole-cell patch clamp recordings of fast-spiking, PV+ cells in the CA1 region of an intact hippocampal preparation in vitro to derive cellular properties, from which we constrained an Izhikevich-type model. Novel, biologically constrained network models were constructed with these individual cell models, and we investigated networks across a range of experimentally determined excitatory inputs and inhibitory synaptic strengths. For each network, we determined network frequency and coherence. Network simulations produce coherent firing at high frequencies (\&gt; 90 Hz) for parameter ranges in which PV-PV inhibitory synaptic conductances are necessarily small and external excitatory inputs are relatively large. Interestingly, our networks produce sharp transitions between random and coherent firing, and this sharpness is lost when connectivity is increased beyond biological estimates. Our work suggests that CA1 networks may be designed with mechanisms for quickly gating in and out of high frequency coherent population rhythms, which may be essential in the generation of nested theta/high frequency rhythms.},

Despite the number of hypotheses such as mechanosensitive ion channels and intermembrane cavitation, they fail to explain all of the observed experimental effects. Here we are investigating the ionic concentration change as a prime mechanism for the neurostimulation by the ultrasound. Approach. We derive the direct analytical relationship between the mechanical deformations in the tissue and the electric boundary conditions for the cable theory equations and solve them for two types of neuronal axon models: Hodgkin--Huxley and C-fibre. We detect the activation thresholds for a variety of ultrasound stimulation cases including continuous and pulsed ultrasound and estimate the mechanical deformations required for reaching the thresholds and generating action potentials (APs). Main results. We note that the proposed mechanism strongly depends on the mechanical properties of the neural tissues, which at the moment cannot be located in literature with the required certainty. We conclude that given certain common linear assumptions, this mechanism alone cannot cause significant effects and be responsible for neurostimulation. However, we also conclude that if the lower estimation of mechanical properties of neural tissues in literature is true, or if the normal cavitation occurs during the ultrasound stimulation, the proposed mechanism can be a prime cause for the generation of APs. Significance. The approach allows prediction and modelling of most observed experimental effects, including the probabilistic ones, without the need for any extra physical effects or additional parameters.},

  abstract = {During walking, the six legs of a stick insect can be coordinated in different temporal sequences or gaits. Leg coordination in each gait is controlled and stabilized by coordinating mechanisms that affect the action of the segmental neuronal networks for walking pattern generation. At present, the motor program for single walking legs in the absence of movement-related coordinating intersegmental influences from the other legs is not known. This knowledge is a prerequisite for the investigation of the segmental neuronal mechanisms that control the movements of a leg and to study the effects of intersegmental coordinating input. A stick insect single middle leg walking preparation has been established that is able to actively perform walking movements on a treadband. The walking pattern showed a clear division into stance and swing phases and, in the absence of ground contact, the leg performed searching movements. We describe the activity patterns of the leg muscles and motoneurons supplying the coxa-trochanteral joint, the femur-tibial joint, and the tarsal leg joints of the middle leg during both walking and searching movements. Furthermore we describe the temporal coordination between them. During walking movements, the coupling between the leg joints was phase-constant; in contrast during searching movements, the coupling between the leg joints was dependent on cycle period. The motor pattern of the single leg generated during walking exhibits similarities with the motor pattern generated during a tripod gait in an intact animal. The generation of walking movements also drives the activity of thoraco-coxal motoneurons of the deafferented and de-efferented thoraco-coxal leg joint in a phase-locked manner, with protractor motoneurons being active during swing and retractor motoneurons being active during stance. These results show that for the single middle leg, a basic walking motor pattern is generated sharing similarities with the tripod gait and that the influence of the motor pattern generated in the distal leg joints is sufficient for driving the activity of coxal motoneurons so an overall motor pattern resembling forward walking is generated.}

  abstract = {The complex and melodic nature of many birds' songs has raised interest in potential parallels between avian vocal sequences and human speech. The similarities between birdsong and speech in production and learning are well established, but surprisingly little is known about how birds perceive song sequences. One popular laboratory songbird, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), has recently attracted attention as an avian model for human speech, in part because the male learns to produce the individual elements in its song motif in a fixed sequence. But psychoacoustic evidence shows that adult zebra finches are relatively insensitive to the sequential features of song syllables. Instead, zebra finches and other birds seem to be exquisitely sensitive to the acoustic details of individual syllables to a degree that is beyond human hearing capacity. Based on these findings, we present a finite-state model of zebra finch perception of song syllable sequences and discuss the rich informational capacity of their vocal system. Furthermore, we highlight the abilities of budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus), a parrot species, to hear sequential features better than zebra finches and suggest that neurophysiological investigations comparing these species could prove fruitful for uncovering neural mechanisms for auditory sequence perception in human speech.

  abstract = {Van der Pol's equation for a relaxation oscillator is generalized by the addition of terms to produce a pair of non-linear differential equations with either a stable singular point or a limit cycle. The resulting ``BVP model'' has two variables of state, representing excitability and refractoriness, and qualitatively resembles Bonhoeffer's theoretical model for the iron wire model of nerve. This BVP model serves as a simple representative of a class of excitable-oscillatory systems including the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model of the squid giant axon. The BVP phase plane can be divided into regions corresponding to the physiological states of nerve fiber (resting, active, refractory, enhanced, depressed, etc.) to form a ``physiological state diagram,'' with the help of which many physiological phenomena can be summarized. A properly chosen projection from the 4-dimensional HH phase space onto a plane produces a similar diagram which shows the underlying relationship between the two models. Impulse trains occur in the BVP and HH models for a range of constant applied currents which make the singular point representing the resting state unstable. {\copyright} 1961, The Biophysical Society.

While there is knowledge about the natural history of this species, what is currently lacking is an integration of findings from the laboratory and the field.

The thermodynamic H-H model of voltage dependent conductances is more physically plausible, as it constrains and parameterises its empirical fit by assuming that ion channel transition rates depend exponentially on a free energy barrier that in turn, linearly or non-linearly, depends on voltage. The original H-H model contains no explicit temperature terms and requires Q10 factors to describe data at different temperatures. The thermodynamic H-H model does have explicit terms for temperature. Do these endow the model with extrapolation for temperature? We utilised voltage clamp data for a voltage-gated K+ current, recorded at three different temperatures. The thermodynamic H-H model's free parameters were fitted (Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm) to a data set recorded at one (or more) temperature(s). Then we assessed whether it could describe another data set, recorded at a different temperature, with these same free parameter values and its temperature terms set to the new temperature. We found that it could not.},

  abstract = {In vitro neuronal cultures exhibit spontaneous electrophysiological activity that can be modulated by chemical stimulation and can be monitored over time by using Micro-Electrode Arrays (MEAs), devices composed by a glass substrate and metal electrodes. Dissociated networks respond to transmitters, their blockers and many other pharmacological substances, including neurotoxic compounds. In this paper we present results related to the effects, both acute (i.e. 1. hour after the treatment) and chronic (3. days after the treatment), of increasing glutamatergic transmission induced by the application of rising concentrations of glutamate and its agonists ({$\alpha$}-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid - AMPA, N-methyl-D-aspartate - NMDA and AMPA together with cyclothiazide - CTZ). Increase of available glutamate was obtained in two ways: 1) by direct application of exogenous glutamate and 2) by inhibiting the clearance of the endogenously released glutamate through DL-threo-{$\beta$}-benzyloxyaspartate (TBOA). Our findings show that fine modulations (i.e. low concentrations of drug) of the excitatory synaptic transmission are reflected in the electrophysiological activation of the network, while intervention leading to excessive direct stimulation of glutamatergic pathways (i.e. medium and high concentrations of drug) results in the abolishment of the electrophysiological activity and eventually cell death. The results obtained by means of the MEA recordings have been compared to the analysis of cell viability to confirm the excitotoxic effect of the applied drug. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that MEA-coupled cortical networks are very sensitive to pharmacological manipulation of the excitatory ionotropic glutamatergic transmission and might provide sensitive endpoints to detect acute and chronic neurotoxic effects of chemicals and drugs for predictive toxicity testing. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Is there more to bursts than a figure of speech? After all, sudden bouts of high-frequency firing are expected to occur whenever inputs surge. The burst coding hypothesis advances that the neural code has three syllables: silences, spikes and bursts. We review evidence supporting this ternary code in terms of devoted mechanisms for burst generation, synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. We also review the learning and attention theories for which such a triad is beneficial.},

While this block is spatially precise and reversible in sensory and motor neurons, the mechanism of block is not clearly understood. Model predictions show that, at elevated temperatures, the rates of opening and closing of the voltage gated ion channels are disrupted and normal functioning of the gates is hindered. A model combining NEURON with Python is presented here that can simulate the behavior of unmyelinated nerve axons in the presence of spatially and temporally varying temperature distributions. Axon behavior and underlying mechanism leading to conduction block is investigated. The ability to understand the photothermal interaction of laser light and temperature dependence of membrane ion channels in-silico will help speed explorations of parameter space and guide future experiments testing the feasibility of selectively blocking pain conduction fibers (Photonic Analgesia of Nerves (PAIN)) in humans.}

In this paper, we analyze the variability of the intervals comprising the rhythm in a model of a mollusk feeding CPG. We measured the cycle-by-cycle time intervals of the CPG rhythm under distinct single neuron stimulation. We characterized interval variability and report dynamical invariants found only for specific time intervals building the sequence of the feeding CPG.

  abstract = {All functions of the nervous system are contingent upon the precise organization of neuronal connections that are initially patterned during development, and then continually modified throughout life. Determining the mechanisms that specify the formation and functional modulation of synaptic circuitry are critical to advancing both our fundamental understanding of the nervous system as well as the various neurodevelopmental, neurological, neuropsychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders that are met in clinical practice when these processes go awry. Defining the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying nervous system development, function, and pathology has proven challenging, due mainly to the complexity of the vertebrate brain. Simple model system approaches with invertebrate preparations, on the other hand, have played pivotal roles in elucidating the fundamental mechanisms underlying the formation and plasticity of individual synapses, and the contributions of individual neurons and their synaptic connections that underlie a variety of behaviors, and learning and memory. In this Review, we discuss the experimental utility of the invertebrate mollusc Lymnaea stagnalis, with a particular emphasis on in vitro cell culture, semi-intact and in vivo preparations, which enable molecular and electrophysiological identification of the cellular and molecular mechanisms governing the formation, plasticity, and specificity of individual synapses at a single-neuron or single-synapse resolution.},

  abstract = {Cheetahs and beetles run, dolphins and salmon swim, and bees and birds fly with grace and economy surpassing our technology. Evolution has shaped the breathtaking abilities of animals, leaving us the challenge of reconstructing their targets of control and mechanisms of dexterity. In this review we explore a corner of this fascinating world. We describe mathematical models for legged animal locomotion, focusing on rapidly running insects and highlighting past achievements and challenges that remain. Newtonian body--limb dynamics are most naturally formulated as piecewise-holonomic rigid body mechanical systems, whose constraints change as legs touch down or lift off. Central pattern generators and proprioceptive sensing require models of spiking neurons and simplified phase oscillator descriptions of ensembles of them. A full neuromechanical model of a running animal requires integration of these elements, along with proprioceptive feedback and models of goal-oriented sensing, planning, and learning. We outline relevant background material from biomechanics and neurobiology, explain key properties of the hybrid dynamical systems that underlie legged locomotion models, and provide numerous examples of such models, from the simplest, completely soluble "peg-leg walker" to complex neuromuscular subsystems that are yet to be assembled into models of behaving animals. This final integration in a tractable and illuminating model is an outstanding challenge.},

However, our knowledge of active dendrites has been almost entirely acquired from studies of rodents. In this work, we investigated the dendrites of layer 2 and 3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons of the human cerebral cortex ex vivo. In these neurons, we discovered a class of calcium-mediated dendritic action potentials (dCaAPs) whose waveform and effects on neuronal output have not been previously described. In contrast to typical all-or-none action potentials, dCaAPs were graded; their amplitudes were maximal for threshold-level stimuli but dampened for stronger stimuli. These dCaAPs enabled the dendrites of individual human neocortical pyramidal neurons to classify linearly nonseparable inputs-a computation conventionally thought to require multilayered networks.},

In neuroscience, data-driven models of neural circuits that span multiple scales are increasingly being used to understand brain function in health and disease.

To address this, we have developed Open Source Brain, a platform for sharing, viewing, analyzing, and simulating standardized models from different brain regions and species. Model structure and parameters can be automatically visualized and their dynamical properties explored through browser-based simulations. Infrastructure and tools for collaborative interaction, development, and testing are also provided.

These features of Open Source Brain improve the accessibility, transparency, and reproducibility of models and facilitate their reuse by the wider community.},

Plasticity is also essential for the maintenance of stable patterns of activity in the face of variable environmental and internal conditions. Previous theoretical and experimental results suggest that neurons stabilize their activity by altering the number or characteristics of ion channels to regulate their intrinsic electrical properties. We present both experimental and modeling evidence to show that activity-dependent regulation of conductances, operating at the level of individual neurons, can also stabilize network activity. These results indicate that the stomatogastric ganglion of the crab can generate a characteristic rhythmic pattern of activity in two fundamentally different modes of operation. In one mode, the rhythm is strictly conditional on the presence of neuromodulatory afferents from adjacent ganglia. In the other, it is independent of neuromodulatory input but relies on newly developed intrinsic properties of the component neurons.},

Our method is scalable in parameters and data features and can rapidly analyze new data after initial training. We demonstrate the power and flexibility of our approach on receptive fields, ion channels, and Hodgkin--Huxley models. We also characterize the space of circuit configurations giving rise to rhythmic activity in the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion, and use these results to derive hypotheses for underlying compensation mechanisms.

INS promises to be an attractive alternative for neural interfaces. With this method, one can attain spatially selective neural stimulation that is not possible with electrical stimulation. INS is based on the delivery of short laser pulses that result in a transient temperature increase in the tissue and depolarize the neurons. At a high stimulation rate and/or high pulse energy, the method bears the risk of thermal damage to the tissue from the instantaneous temperature increase or from potential accumulation of thermal energy. With the present study, we determined the injury thresholds in guinea pig cochleae for acute INS using functional measurements (compound action potentials) and histological evaluation. The selected laser parameters for INS were the wavelength ({$\lambda$} = 1,869 nm), the pulse duration (100 {$\mu$}s), the pulse repetition rate (250 Hz), and the radiant energy (0-127 {$\mu$}J/pulse). For up to 5 hr of continuous irradiation at 250 Hz and at radiant energies up to 25 {$\mu$}J/pulse, we did not observe any functional or histological damage in the cochlea. Functional loss was observed for energies above 25 {$\mu$}J/pulse and the probability of injury to the target tissue resulting in functional loss increased with increasing radiant energy. Corresponding cochlear histology from control animals and animals exposed to 98 or 127 {$\mu$}J/pulse at 250 Hz pulse repetition rate did not show a loss of spiral ganglion cells, hair cells, or other soft tissue structures of the organ of Corti. Light microscopy did not reveal any structural changes in the soft tissue either. Additionally, microcomputed tomography was used to visualize the placement of the optical fiber within the cochlea. {\copyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicasl, Inc.},

  abstract = {In this primer, we give a review of the inverse problem for EEG source localization. This is intended for the researchers new in the field to get insight in the state-of-the-art techniques used to find approximate solutions of the brain sources giving rise to a scalp potential recording. Furthermore, a review of the performance results of the different techniques is provided to compare these different inverse solutions. The authors also include the results of a Monte-Carlo analysis which they performed to compare four non parametric algorithms and hence contribute to what is presently recorded in the literature. An extensive list of references to the work of other researchers is also provided. This paper starts off with a mathematical description of the inverse problem and proceeds to discuss the two main categories of methods which were developed to solve the EEG inverse problem, mainly the non parametric and parametric methods. The main difference between the two is to whether a fixed number of dipoles is assumed a priori or not. Various techniques falling within these categories are described including minimum norm estimates and their generalizations, LORETA, sLORETA, VARETA, S-MAP, ST-MAP, Backus-Gilbert, LAURA, Shrinking LORETA FOCUSS (SLF), SSLOFO and ALF for non parametric methods and beamforming techniques, BESA, subspace techniques such as MUSIC and methods derived from it, FINES, simulated annealing and computational intelligence algorithms for parametric methods. From a review of the performance of these techniques as documented in the literature, one could conclude that in most cases the LORETA solution gives satisfactory results. In situations involving clusters of dipoles, higher resolution algorithms such as MUSIC or FINES are however preferred. Imposing reliable biophysical and psychological constraints, as done by LAURA has given superior results. The Monte-Carlo analysis performed, comparing WMN, LORETA, sLORETA and SLF, for different noise levels and different simulated source depths has shown that for single source localization, regularized sLORETA gives the best solution in terms of both localization error and ghost sources. Furthermore the computationally intensive solution given by SLF was not found to give any additional benefits under such simulated conditions.}

In particular, observing and feeding back the effects of circuit interventions on physiologically relevant timescales is valuable for directly testing whether inferred models of dynamics, connectivity, and causation are accurate in~vivo.

  abstract = {A fundamental question in comparative neuroethology is the extent to which synaptic wiring determines behavior vs. the extent to which it is constrained by phylogeny. We investigated this by examining the connectivity and activity of homologous neurons in different species. Melibe leonina and Dendronotus iris (Mollusca, Gastropoda, Nudibranchia) have homologous neurons and exhibit homologous swimming behaviors consisting of alternating left-right (LR) whole body flexions. Yet, a homologous interneuron (Si1) differs between the two species in its participation in the swim motor pattern (SMP) and synaptic connectivity. In this study we examined Si1 homologs in two additional nudibranchs: Flabellina iodinea, which evolved LR swimming independently of Melibe and Dendronotus, and Tritonia diomedea, which swims with dorsal-ventral (DV) body flexions. In Flabellina, the contralateral Si1s exhibit alternating rhythmic bursting activity during the SMP and are members of the swim central pattern generator (CPG), as in Melibe. The Si1 homologs in Tritonia do not burst rhythmically during the DV SMP but are inhibited and receive bilaterally synchronous synaptic input. In both Flabellina and Tritonia, the Si1 homologs exhibit reciprocal inhibition, as in Melibe. However, in Flabellina the inhibition is polysynaptic, whereas in Tritonia it is monosynaptic, as in Melibe. In all species, the contralateral Si1s are electrically coupled. These results suggest that Flabellina and Melibe convergently evolved a swim CPG that contains Si1; however, they differ in monosynaptic connections. Connectivity is more similar between Tritonia and Melibe, which exhibit different swimming behaviors. Thus connectivity between homologous neurons varies independently of both behavior and phylogeny. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY This research shows that the synaptic connectivity between homologous neurons exhibits species-specific variations on a basic theme. The neurons vary in the extent of electrical coupling and reciprocal inhibition. They also exhibit different patterns of activity during rhythmic motor behaviors that are not predicted by their circuitry. The circuitry does not map onto the phylogeny in a predictable fashion either. Thus neither neuronal homology nor species behavior is predictive of neural circuit connectivity.},

Previous work, done in the presence of descending modulatory inputs, had shown that the pyloric rhythm of the crab increases in frequency as temperature increases but maintains its characteristic phase relationships until it ``crashes'' at extremely high temperatures. To study the interaction between neuromodulators and temperature perturbations, we studied the effects of temperature on preparations from which the descending modulatory inputs were removed. Under these conditions, the pyloric rhythm was destabilized. We then studied the effects of temperature on preparations in the presence of oxotremorine, proctolin, and serotonin. Oxotremorine and proctolin enhanced the robustness of the pyloric rhythm, whereas serotonin made the rhythm less robust. These experiments reveal considerable animal-to-animal diversity in their crash stability, consistent with the interpretation that cryptic differences in many cell and network parameters are revealed by extreme perturbations. The crab Cancer borealis experiences substantial changes in ocean water temperature both daily and seasonally. Modulatory substances alter the range of temperatures over which one of the crab's rhythmic motor patterns can function normally.},

  abstract = {Sequences of motor activity are encoded in many vertebrate brains by complex spatio-temporal patterns of neural activity; however, the neural circuit mechanisms underlying the generation of these pre-motor patterns are poorly understood. In songbirds, one prominent site of pre-motor activity is the forebrain robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA), which generates stereotyped sequences of spike bursts during song and recapitulates these sequences during sleep. We show that the stereotyped sequences in RA are driven from nucleus HVC (high vocal centre), the principal pre-motor input to RA. Recordings of identified HVC neurons in sleeping and singing birds show that individual HVC neurons projecting onto RA neurons produce bursts sparsely, at a single, precise time during the RA sequence. These HVC neurons burst sequentially with respect to one another. We suggest that at each time in the RA sequence, the ensemble of active RA neurons is driven by a subpopulation of RA-projecting HVC neurons that is active only at that time. As a population, these HVC neurons may form an explicit representation of time in the sequence. Such a sparse representation, a temporal analogue of the 'grandmother cell' concept for object recognition, eliminates the problem of temporal interference during sequence generation and learning attributed to more distributed representations. {\copyright} 2002 Nature Publishing Group.},

The basic patch clamp recording circuit, and designs for improved frequency response are described along with the present limitations in recording the currents from single channels. 4. Procedures for preparation and recording from three representative cell types are given. Some properties of single acetylcholine-activated channels in muscle membrane are described to illustrate the improved current and time resolution achieved with giga-seals. 5. A description is given of the various ways that patches of membrane can be physically isolated from cells. This isolation enables the recording of single channel currents with well-defined solutions on both sides of the membrane. Two types of isolated cell-free patch configurations can be formed: an inside-out patch with its cytoplasmic membrane face exposed to the bath solution, and an outside-out patch with its extracellular membrane face exposed to the bath solution. 6. The application of the method for the recording of ionic currents and internal dialysis of small cells is considered. Single channel resolution can be achieved when recording from whole cells, if the cell diameter is small (less than 20 micrometer). 7.

DBS can be tailored to the patient's symptoms and targeted to various nodes along the basal ganglia--thalamus circuitry, which mediates the various symptoms of the illness; DBS in the thalamus is most efficient for tremors, and DBS in the pallidum most efficient for rigidity and dyskinesias, whereas DBS in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) can treat both tremors, akinesia, rigidity and dyskinesias, and allows for decrease in doses of medications even in patients with advanced stages of the disease, which makes it the preferred target for DBS. However, DBS in the STN assumes that the patient is not too old, with no cognitive decline or relevant depression, and does not exhibit severe and medically resistant axial symptoms such as balance and gait disturbances, and falls. Dysarthria is the most common side effect of DBS, regardless of the brain target. DBS has a long-lasting effect on appendicular symptoms, but with progression of disease, nondopaminergic axial features become less responsive to DBS. DBS for PD is highly specialised; to enable adequate selection and follow-up of patients, DBS requires dedicated multidisciplinary teams of movement disorder neurologists, functional neurosurgeons, specialised DBS nurses and neuropsychologists.,},

L5b pyramidal cells have been the subject of extensive experimental and modeling studies, yet conductance-based models of these cells that faithfully reproduce both their perisomatic Na+-spiking behavior as well as key dendritic active properties, including Ca2+ spikes and back-propagating action potentials, are still lacking. Based on a large body of experimental recordings from both the soma and dendrites of L5b pyramidal cells in adult rats, we characterized key features of the somatic and dendritic firing and quantified their statistics. We used these features to constrain the density of a set of ion channels over the soma and dendritic surface via multi-objective optimization with an evolutionary algorithm, thus generating a set of detailed conductance-based models that faithfully replicate the back-propagating action potential activated Ca2+ spike firing and the perisomatic firing response to current steps, as well as the experimental variability of the properties. Furthermore, we show a useful way to analyze model parameters with our sets of models, which enabled us to identify some of the mechanisms responsible for the dynamic properties of L5b pyramidal cells as well as mechanisms that are sensitive to morphological changes. This automated framework can be used to develop a database of faithful models for other neuron types. The models we present provide several experimentally-testable predictions and can serve as a powerful tool for theoretical investigations of the contribution of single-cell dynamics to network activity and its computational capabilities.},

  abstract = {The effects of temperature on transmission through the voltage-sensitive giant motor synapse (GMS) were investigated in crayfish both experimentally and in computer simulation. The GMS is part of the fast reflex escape pathway of the crayfish and mediates activation from the lateral giant (LG) command neurone to the motor giant (MoG) flexor motoneurone. The investigation was motivated by an apparent mismatch between the temperature sensitivity of the activation time constant of the GMS, with a Q10 reported to be close to 11, and that of the active membrane properties of LG and MoG, which are thought to have Q10 values close to 3. Our initial hypothesis was that at cold temperatures the very slow activation of the GMS conductance would reduce the effectiveness of transmission compared with higher temperatures. However, the reverse was found to be the case. Effective transmission through the GMS was reliable at low temperatures, but failed at an upper temperature limit that varied between 12{$^\circ$}C and 25{$^\circ$}C in isolated nerve cord preparations. The upper limit was extended above 30{$^\circ$}C in semi-intact preparations where the GMS was less disturbed by dissection. The results of experiments and simulations both indicate that transmission becomes more reliable at low temperatures because the longer-duration presynaptic spikes are able to drive more current through the GMS into the MoG, which is more excitable at low temperatures. Conversely, effective transmission is difficult at high temperatures because the transfer of charge through the GMS is reduced and because the input resistance of MoG is lowered as its current threshold is increased. The effect of the high Q10 of the GMS activation is to help preserve effective transmission through the synapse at high temperatures and so extend the temperature range for effective operation of the escape circuit.s},

  abstract = {Multichannel tetrode array recording in awake behaving animals provides a powerful method to record the activity of large numbers of neurons. The power of this method could be extended if further information concerning the intracellular state of the neurons could be extracted from the extra- cellularly recorded signals. Toward this end, we have simultaneously recorded intracellular and extracellular signals from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and interneurons in the anesthetized rat. We found that several intracellular parameters can be deduced from extracellular spike waveforms. The width of the intracellular action potential is defined precisely by distinct points on the extracellular spike. Amplitude changes of the intracellular action potential are reflected by changes in the amplitude of the initial negative phase of the extracellular spike, and these amplitude changes are dependent on the state of the network. In addition, intracellular recordings from dendrites with simultaneous extracellular recordings from the soma indicate that, on average, action potentials are initiated in the perisomatic region and propagate to the dendrites at 1.68 m/s. Finally we determined that a tetrode in hippocampal area CA1 theoretically should be able to record electrical signals from 1,000 neurons. Of these, 60-100 neurons should generate spikes of sufficient amplitude to be detectable from the noise and to allow for their separation using current spatial clustering methods. This theoretical maximum is in contrast to the approximately six units that are usually detected per tetrode. From this, we conclude that a large percentage of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells are silent in any given behavioral condition.},

In this paper we consider recently revealed strategies that living CPGs follow to design CPG control paradigms for modular robots. To illustrate them, we divide the task of designing an example CPG for a modular robot into independent problems. We formulate each problem in a general way and provide a bio-inspired solution for each of them: locomotion information coding, individual module control and inter-module coordination. We analyse the stability of the CPG numerically, and then test it on a real robot. We analyse steady state locomotion and recovery after perturbations. In both cases, the robot is able to autonomously find a stable effective locomotion state. Finally, we discuss how these strategies can result in a more general design approach for CPG-based locomotion.},

By using stability analysis we show that one of these equilibrium points is a saddle point from which there are two separatrices which divide the phase plane into two regions. In one region all phase paths approach a limit cycle and in the other all phase paths approach a stable equilibrium point. A consequence of this is that a short depolarizing current pulse will change an initially silent model neuron into one that fires repetitively. Addition of a third equation limits this firing to either an isolated burst or a depolarizing afterpotential. When steady depolarizing current was applied to this model it resulted in periodic bursting. The equations, which were initially developed to explain isolated triggered bursts, therefore provide one of the simplest models of the more general phenomenon of oscillatory burst discharge.},

This depolarization is reversible, does not occur with CW laser light, and appears to be due to multiphoton excitation. We describe two regimes of multiphoton optical stimulation. Low intensity, long duration laser irradiation produces a sustained depolarization, insensitive to sodium channel blockers yet sensitive to antioxidants. On the other hand, high intensity, short duration irradiation can induce fast depolarizations, which appear due to different mechanism. The combination of multiphoton stimulation and optical probing could enable systematic analysis of circuits. {\copyright} 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {In this paper, hybrid brain-computer interface (hBCI) technologies for improving classification accuracy and increasing the number of commands are reviewed. Hybridization combining more than two modalities is a new trend in brain imaging and prosthesis control. Electroencephalography (EEG), due to its easy use and fast temporal resolution, is most widely utilized in combination with other brain/non-brain signal acquisition modalities, for instance, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), electromyography (EMG), electrooculography (EOG), eye tracker, etc. Three main purposes of hybridization are to increase the number of control commands, improve classification accuracy, and reduce the signal detection time. Currently, such combinations of EEG+fNIRS and EEG+EOG are most commonly employed. Four principal components (i.e., hardware, paradigm, classifiers, features) relevant to accuracy improvement are discussed. In the case of brain signals, motor imagination/movement tasks are combined with cognitive tasks to increase active BCI accuracy. Active and reactive tasks sometimes are combined: motor imagination with steady-state evoked visual potentials (SSVEP), and motor imagination with P300, etc. In the case of reactive tasks, SSVEP is most widely combined with P300 to increase the number of commands. Passive BCIs, however, are rare. After discussing the hardware and strategies involved in the development of hBCI, the second part examines the approaches used to increase the number of control commands and to enhance classification accuracy. The future prospects and the extension of hBCI in real-time applications for daily life scenarios are provided.}

I investigated this issue in the well-defined, rhythmic pyloric neural network. When pyloric cycle frequency is altered three- to fivefold, pyloric inter-neuronal delays shift by hundreds to thousands of msec, and all pyloric pattern elements show strong phase maintenance. The experimental paradigm used is unlikely to activate exogenous inputs to the network, and these delay changes are thus likely to arise from phase-compensatory mechanisms intrinsic to the network. Pyloric inter-neuronal delays depend on the time constants of the network's synapses and of the membrane properties of its neurons. The observed delay shifts thus suggest that, in response to changes in overall cycle frequency, these constants vary so as to maintain pattern phasing.},

Here we investigate a possible reason for this topological structure using the ability to perform a biologically functional task as a measure of the efficacy of the network. When the CPG is composed of model neurons that exhibit regular membrane voltage oscillations, open topologies are as able to maximize this functionality as non-open topologies. When we replace these models by neurons which exhibit chaotic membrane voltage oscillations, the functional criterion selects non-open topologies. As isolated neurons from invertebrate CPGs are known in some cases to undergo chaotic oscillations, this suggests that there is a biological basis for the class of non-open network topologies that we observe.},

  abstract = {Heterogeneity is the norm in biology. The brain is no different: Neuronal cell types are myriad, reflected through their cellular morphology, type, excitability, connectivity motifs, and ion channel distributions. While this biophysical diversity enriches neural systems' dynamical repertoire, it remains challenging to reconcile with the robustness and persistence of brain function over time (resilience). To better understand the relationship between excitability heterogeneity (variability in excitability within a population of neurons) and resilience, we analyzed both analytically and numerically a nonlinear sparse neural network with balanced excitatory and inhibitory connections evolving over long time scales. Homogeneous networks demonstrated increases in excitability, and strong firing rate correlations---signs of instability---in response to a slowly varying modulatory fluctuation. Excitability heterogeneity tuned network stability in a context-dependent way by restraining responses to modulatory challenges and limiting firing rate correlations, while enriching dynamics during states of low modulatory drive. Excitability heterogeneity was found to implement a homeostatic control mechanism enhancing network resilience to changes in population size, connection probability, strength and variability of synaptic weights, by quenching the volatility (i.e., its susceptibility to critical transitions) of its dynamics. Together, these results highlight the fundamental role played by cell-to-cell heterogeneity in the robustness of brain function in the face of change.},

Lasers allow more selective spatial resolution of stimulation than the conventional electrical stimulation. To date, few studies have examined pulsed, mid-infrared laser stimulation of nerves and very little of the available optical parameter space has been studied. In this study, a pulsed diode laser, with wavelength between 1.844-1.873 {$\mu$}m, was used to elicit compound action potentials (CAPs) from the auditory system of the gerbil. We found that pulse durations as short as 35 {$\mu$}s elicit a CAP from the cochlea. In addition, repetition rates up to 13 Hz can continually stimulate cochlear spiral ganglion cells for extended periods of time. Varying the wavelength and, therefore, the optical penetration depth, allowed different populations of neurons to be stimulated. The technology of optical stimulation could significantly improve cochlear implants, which are hampered by a lack of spatial selectivity. {\copyright} 2007 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Ongoing fluctuations of brain activity measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provide a novel window onto the organizational principles of brain function. Advances in data analysis have focussed on extracting the constituting elements of temporal dynamics in terms of activity or connectivity patterns. Subsequently, brain states can be defined and then be analyzed using temporal features and computational models as to capture subtle interactions between functional networks. These new methodological advances allow to deconstruct the rich spatiotemporal structure of functional components that dynamically assemble into resting-state networks long been observed using conventional measures of functional connectivity. Applications of these emerging methods demonstrate that changes in functional connectivity are indeed driven by complex reorganization of network interactions, and thus provide valuable observations to build better models of brain function and dysfunction. Here, we give an overview of the recent developments in this exciting field, together with main findings and perspectives on future research.}

  abstract = {One contribution of 16 to a discussion meeting issue 'Homology and convergence in nervous system evolution'. Comparisons of rhythmic movements and the central pattern generators (CPGs) that control them uncover principles about the evolution of behaviour and neural circuits. Over the course of evolutionary history, gradual evolution of behaviours and their neural circuitry within any lineage of animals has been a predominant occurrence. Small changes in gene regulation can lead to divergence of circuit organization and corresponding changes in behaviour. However, some behavioural divergence has resulted from large-scale rewiring of the neural network. Divergence of CPG circuits has also occurred without a corresponding change in behaviour. When analogous rhythmic behaviours have evolved independently, it has generally been with different neural mechanisms. Repeated evolution of particular rhythmic behaviours has occurred within some lineages due to parallel evolution or latent CPGs. Particular motor pattern generating mechanisms have also evolved independently in separate lineages. The evolution of CPGs and rhythmic behaviours shows that although most behaviours and neural circuits are highly conserved, the nature of the behaviour does not dictate the neural mechanism and that the presence of homologous neural components does not determine the behaviour. This suggests that although behaviour is generated by neural circuits, natural selection can act separately on these two levels of biological organization.},

The laser-evoked depolarizations (LEDs) exhibited complex, multiphasic kinetics comprising fast and slow components. There was no discernable difference in the LEDs in intact ganglion neurons and in acutely isolated neurons. Thus, the LED sensor seems to reside within the neuronal membrane. The near-uniform distribution of responsive neurons increased membrane conductance, and the negative reversal potential value (-41{\textpm}2.9 mV) suggests that LED is unrelated to the activation of heat-sensitive transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 channels. The long duration of LEDs favors an involvement of second messengers. {\copyright} 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health {\textbar} Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

First, an overview is given of research on the cognitive-motor processes that enable individuals to represent joint action goals and to anticipate, attend and adapt to other's actions in real time. Second, the neurophysiological mechanisms that underpin rhythmic interpersonal coordination are sought in studies of sensorimotor and cognitive processes that play a role in the representation and integration of selfand other-related actions within and between individuals' brains. Finally, relationships between social--psychological factors and rhythmic interpersonal coordination are considered from two perspectives, one concerning how social-cognitive tendencies (e.g. empathy) affect coordination, and the other concerning how coordination affects interpersonal affiliation, trust and prosocial behaviour. Our review highlights musical ensemble performance as an ecologically valid yet readily controlled domain for investigating rhythm in joint action.},

These are pattern-generating neurons that are active in the protraction of the radula and rasping phases, respectively, of the feeding cycle of the pond snail. The N1 or N2 feeding interneurons in the buccal ganglia were filled with the fluorescent dye 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (5-CF) from the cut end of the nerve that contains their axon. Filling the cerebrobuccal connective (N = 151) stained just one N1 cell in the contralateral buccal ganglion. Filling the postbuccal nerve stained neurons symmetrically in both buccal ganglia (N = 75): only one labeled cell in each ganglion is an N2 interneuron. The feeding rhythm was evoked by depolarizing a modulatory neuron, the SO, located in the buccal ganglia. The axonally filled N1 interneuron was irradiated at its axon in the buccal commissure with blue laser light (intensity of 0.5 MW {$\cdot$} m-2). Irradiation of just one N1 completely blocked the feeding rhythm (seven preparations). In seven further preparations, N1 ablation slowed the SO-driven feeding rhythm and weakened the N1 input to the feeding neurons. Irradiation of the cell bodies of both the filled left and right N2 interneurons killed the cells but did not produce any consistent change in the feeding rate (15 preparations). The feeding interneurons and motoneurons still showed the characteristic N2 phase synaptic inputs, so more, as yet unidentified, N2 neurons must be located in other parts of the buccal ganglia. We conclude that the participation of the identified N1 interneurons is essential for the normal feeding pattern while other, still to be identified N2 neurons must be present and must contribute to the feeding rhythm. We suggest that the extra redundancy of the N2 network may be related to the greater necessity of sensory feedback control during rasping than during protraction of the radula.},

The compact central nervous system of Lymnaea, with its beautiful brightly-pigmented orange neurons has been attractive to many neuroscientists interested in relating the molecular and electrical properties of neurons to behavior. Individual neurons can be identified as parts of behavioral circuits and their synaptic connectivities determined by electrophysiological recording. The ability to grow Lymnaea neurons in cell culture has allowed the in vitro reconstruction of synapses and neural circuits. Early work focused on using Lymnaea giant neurons to analyse the biophysical properties of neurons or investigated the organization of neuroendocrine peptidergic neural networks involved in growth and reproduction. Since then the neural networks underlying a variety of reflexive and rhythmic behaviors have been investigated including feeding, respiration, defensive withdrawal, locomotion, gravity orientation, and reproduction (copulation and egg-laying). Many of these behaviours are highly dynamic leading to exciting recent studies on the neural and molecular mechanisms underlying simple forms of memory formation (Benjamin et al., 2000; Benjamin \& Kemenes, 2010).},

Although the mechanisms by which such neurons activate their target CPGs are known in detail in many systems, their role in the sensory activation of CPG-driven behaviors is poorly understood. In the feeding system of the mollusc Lymnaea, one of the best-studied rhythmical networks, intracellular stimulation of either of two types of neuron, the cerebral ventral 1a (CV1a) and the slow oscillator (SO) cells, leads to robust CPG-driven fictive feeding patterns, suggesting that they might make an important contribution to natural food-activated behavior. In this paper we investigated this contribution using a lip-CNS preparation in which feeding was elicited with a natural chemostimulant rather than intracellular stimulation. We found that despite their CPG-driving capabilities, neither CV1a nor SO were involved in the initial activation of sucrose-evoked fictive feeding, whereas a CPG interneuron, N1M, was active first in almost all preparations. Instead, the two interneurons play important and distinct roles in determining the characteristics of the rhythmic motor output; CV1a by modulating motoneuron burst duration and SO by setting the frequency of the ongoing rhythm. This is an example of a distributed system in which (1) interneurons that drive similar motor patterns when activated artificially contribute differently to the shaping of the motor output when it is evoked by the relevant sensory input, and (2) a CPG rather than a modulatory interneuron type plays the most critical role in initiation of sensory-evoked rhythmic activity.},

Results of the application of three different labelling techniques on wholemount preparations were compared with each other and with the serotonin content of the ganglia, measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Serotonin immunocytochemistry resulted in the highest number of labelled neurons, but the more recently developed in vivo method of 5,6- or 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine-induced pigmentation also proved to be a reliable technique for the visualization of serotonin-containing cell bodies. In comparison with these two techniques, the glyoxylic acid fluorescence method appeared to be less sensitive. The distribution and number of serotonin-containing neurons and biochemically measured serotonin in specific ganglia showed a close correlation. By combining the results of the three labelling techniques, a detailed map of serotonin-containing neurons was constructed, and this was compared with maps of identified neurons prepared from earlier electrophysiological studies. Previously described serotonergic neurons were consistently found, as well as several new serotonin-containirig cell types in the cerebral, visceral and parietal ganglia. A network of serotonin-containing inter- and intraganglionic axon tracts, and thin serotonergic fibres in the perineurium were also demonstrated. This in vivo and in vitro identification of serotonin-containing neurons will facilitate further neurophysiological analysis of serotonergic neural mechanisms in Lymnaea. {\copyright} 1989 Chapman and Hall Ltd.},

They are the most prominent representatives of a system of neurons expressing a gene that is similar to the gene expressed in R15 of Aplysia californica. Both neuronal systems are involved in the regulation of cardiorespiratory phenomena. In the present study the axonal branches of VD1 and RPD2 were mapped using immunocytochemical and tracer studies. To this end the {$\alpha$}1-antiserum (directed to one of the VD1/RPD2 neuropeptides) was used in combination with Lucifer yellow (LY) and Ni-lys tracers. In whole mount preparations of the CNS, immunostained axons of VD1 and RPD2 were observed to run to the pleural, cerebral and pedal ganglia and in several nerves. Upon LY injection of VD1 thin axon branches were observed in the internal right parietal nerve. These run to the skin in the mantle area near the pneumostome and osphradium. The skin of the lips appeared to receive a similar innervation via the lip nerves. Thick LY filled axons of VD1 and RPD2 were observed in the intestinal nerve. They could be traced to the heart region. The pericardial branch of the intestinal nerve innervates the pericardium and heart (Ni-lys tracing). Immunocytochemically, using the {$\alpha$}1-antiserum, it was demonstrated that this nerve branch carries the axons of VD1 and RPD2 to the venous side of the auricle, where they enter the pericardial cavity and ramify in the auricle (but not in the ventricle). Many immunopositive varicosities were observed on the auricular muscle fibers. Comparison of the stainings in the auricle with those obtained with antisera to the cardioactive neuropeptides FMRFamide and SCP showed no colocalization. The functional significance of the axonal distribution patterns of VD1 and RPD2 and the morphological and functional homology of the neurons to R15 of Aplysia are discussed. {\copyright} 1991.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we suggest that cortical anatomy recapitulates the temporal hierarchy that is inherent in the dynamics of environmental states. Many aspects of brain function can be understood in terms of a hierarchy of temporal scales at which representations of the environment evolve. The lowest level of this hierarchy corresponds to fast fluctuations associated with sensory processing, whereas the highest levels encode slow contextual changes in the environment, under which faster representations unfold. First, we describe a mathematical model that exploits the temporal structure of fast sensory input to track the slower trajectories of their underlying causes. This model of sensory encoding or perceptual inference establishes a proof of concept that slowly changing neuronal states can encode the paths or trajectories of faster sensory states. We then review empirical evidence that suggests that a temporal hierarchy is recapitulated in the macroscopic organization of the cortex. This anatomic-temporal hierarchy provides a comprehensive framework for understanding cortical function: the specific time-scale that engages a cortical area can be inferred by its location along a rostro-caudal gradient, which reflects the anatomical distance from primary sensory areas. This is most evident in the prefrontal cortex, where complex functions can be explained as operations on representations of the environment that change slowly. The framework provides predictions about, and principled constraints on, cortical structure--function relationships, which can be tested by manipulating the time-scales of sensory input.},

We show that a plausible candidate for an internal or generative model is a hierarchy of 'stable heteroclinic channels'. This model describes continuous dynamics in the environment as a hierarchy of sequences, where slower sequences cause faster sequences. Under this model, online recognition corresponds to the dynamic decoding of causal sequences, giving a representation of the environment with predictive power on several timescales. We illustrate the ensuing decoding or recognition scheme using synthetic sequences of syllables, where syllables are sequences of phonemes and phonemes are sequences of sound-wave modulations. By presenting anomalous stimuli, we find that the resulting recognition dynamics disclose inference at multiple time scales and are reminiscent of neuronal dynamics seen in the real brain.},

  abstract = {Chaotic regimes in a mathematical model of pacemaker activity in the bursting neurons of a snail, Helix pomatia, have been investigated. The model includes a slow-wave generating mechanism, a spike-generating mechanism, an inward Ca current, intracellular Ca ions, [Ca2+](im), their fast buffering and uptake by intracellular Ca stores, and a [Ca2+](im)-inhibited Ca current. Chemosensitive voltage-activated conductance, g(B)(*) responsible for termination of the spike burst, and chemosensitive sodium conductance, g(Na)(*), responsible for the depolarizing phase of the slow-wave, were used as control parameters. These conductances in intact snail bursting neuron are regulated by neuropeptides. Time courses of the membrane potential and [Ca2+](in) were employed to analyse different regimes in the model. Histograms of interspike intervals, autocorrelograms, spectral characteristics, one-dimensional return maps, phase plane trajectories, positive Lyapunov exponent and especially cascades of period-doubling bifurcations demonstrate that approaches to chaos were generated. The bifurcation diagram as a function of g(B)(*) and the ([Ca2+](in)-V) phase diagram of initial conditions reveal fractal features. It has been observed that a short-lasting depolarizing current or elevation of [Ca2+](in) may evoke transformation of chaotic activity into a regular bursting one. These kinds of transitions do not require any changes in the parameters of the model. The results demonstrate that chaotic regimes of neuronal activity modulated by neuropeptides may play a relevant role in information processing and storage at the level of a single neuron.},

A significant body of literature has occurred over the past four decades regarding motor cortex signal extraction for upper extremity movement or computer interface. However, little is discussed regarding postural or ambulation command signaling. Auditory prosthesis research continues to represent the majority of literature on BCI signal insertion. Significant hurdles continue in the technological translation of BCI implants. These include developing a stable neural interface, significantly increasing signal processing capabilities, and methods of data transfer throughout the human body. The past few years, however, have provided extraordinary human examples of BCI implant potential. Despite technological hurdles, proof-of-concept animal and human studies provide significant encouragement that BCI implants may well find their way into mainstream medical practice in the foreseeable future.},

In this study we evaluated whether transcranial laser stimulation (TLS) with NIR-LLL can modulate the excitability of the motor cortex (M1) as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Methods TLS was applied for 5 minutes over the representation of the right first dorsal interosseal muscle (FDI) in left primary motor cortex (M1), in 14 healthy subjects. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the FDI, elicited by single-pulse TMS, were measured at baseline and up to 30 minutes after the TLS. Results The average MEP size was significantly reduced during the first 20 minutes following the TLS. The pattern was present in 10 (71.5\%) of the participants. The MEP size reduction correlated negatively with the motor threshold at rest. Conclusions TLS with NIR-LLL induced transitory reduction of the excitability of the stimulated cortex. These findings give further insights into the mechanisms of TLS effects in the human cerebral cortex, paving the way for potential applications of TLS in treatment of stroke and in other clinical settings. {\copyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Up until now, these effects have been shown in rodents and humans only. Little is known about their evolutionary origin or biological basis, and the underlying cellular mechanisms also remain relatively elusive. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that preceding motor activity accelerates decision making in an invertebrate, the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. To investigate decision making in a novel environment, snails, which normally live in water, were placed on a flat dry surface to simulate the potentially threatening consequence of being in an arid environment. This stimulus initiated two distinct phases in snail behaviour: slow circular movements, followed by intense locomotion in a chosen direction. The first phase was prolonged when the test arena was symmetrically lit, compared with one with an apparent gradient of light. However, forced muscular locomotion for 2 h prior to the test promoted the transition from random circular motions to a directional crawl, accompanied by an increase in crawling speed but with no effect on the choice of direction. Intense locomotion for 2 h also produced a strong excitatory effect on the activity of serotonergic neurons in L. stagnalis. Our results suggest that the beneficial effects of physical exercise on cognitive performance in mammals might have deep roots in evolution, granting the opportunity to unravel the origins of such effects at the single-neuron and network levels.},

During imagining activation of the same areas without primary sensorimotor areas was shown. We recorded EEG from 58 scalp positions to investigate the temporal sequence and the time course of activation of these areas while violin players prepared to execute, executed, prepared to imagine, or imagined a musical sequence on a violin. During the preparation for the sequence in three of seven musicians investigated the bilateral frontal opercular regions became active earlier than the motor areas and in one of them simultaneously with the motor areas. In two of the musicians a rather variable pattern of activation was observed. The frontal opercular regions were also strongly involved throughout the period of music execution or imagining. The supplementary motor area was involved in both preparation for the sequence and during execution and imagining of the sequence. The left primary sensorimotor area was involved in the preparation and termination of the musical sequence for both execution and imagining. The right sensorimotor area was strongly involved in the preparation for and during the execution of the sequence. We conclude that the bilateral frontal opercular regions are crucial in both preparation for and during music execution and imagining. They may have "mirror neurone" properties that underlie observation or imagining of one's own performance. The motor areas are differentially activated during the preparation and execution or imagining the sequence. {\copyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We have investigated the effect of MLS (Multiwave Locked System) laser near-infrared irradiation on cell membrane structure, functional properties, and free radical generation using human red blood cells and breast cancer MCF-4 cells. The cells were irradiated with low-intensity MLS near-infrared (simultaneously 808 nm, continuous emission and 905 nm, pulse emission, pulse-wave frequency, 1,000 or 2,000 Hz) laser light at light doses from 0 to 15 J (average power density 212.5 mW/cm(2), spot size was 3.18 cm(2)) at 22 {$^\circ$}C, the activity membrane bound acetylcholinesterase, cell stability, anti-oxidative activity, and free radical generation were the parameters used in characterizing the structural and functional changes of the cell. Near-infrared low-intensity laser radiation changed the acetylcholinesterase activity of the red blood cell membrane in a dose-dependent manner: There was a considerable increase of maximal enzymatic rate and Michaelis constant due to changes in the membrane structure. Integral parameters such as erythrocyte stability, membrane lipid peroxidation, or methemoglobin levels remained unchanged. Anti-oxidative capacity of the red blood cells increased after MLS laser irradiation. This irradiation induced a time-dependent increase in free radical generation in MCF-4 cells. Low-intensity near-infrared MLS laser radiation induces free radical generation and changes enzymatic and anti-oxidative activities of cellular components. Free radical generation may be the mechanism of the biomodulative effect of laser radiation.},

We address the problem of characterizing these patterns under the assumption that the bursts exhibit well-defined firing time distributions. We propose a method for estimating these distributions based on a burst alignment al- gorithm that minimizes the overlap among the firing time distributions of the different spikes within the burst. This method provides a good approximation to the burst's intrinsic temporal structure as a set of firing time distributions. In addition, the method allows labeling the spikes in any particular burst, establishing a correspondence between each spike and the distribution that best explains it, and identifying missing spikes. Our results on both simulated and experimental data from the lobster stomatogastric ganglion show that the proposed method provides a re- liable characterization of the intraburst firing patterns and avoids the errors derived from missing spikes. This method can also be applied to nonbursting neurons as a general tool for the study and the interpretation of firing time distributions as part of a temporal neural code. {\copyright}2008 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.}

A specific sequence of these events (code) is chosen to deliver a predefined stimulation in a closed-loop manner. The response to this code-driven stimulation can be used to characterize the system. This methodology was implemented in a real time toolbox and tested in the context of electric fish signaling. We show that while there are codes that evoke a response that cannot be distinguished from a control recording without stimulation, other codes evoke a characteristic distinct response. We also compare the code-driven response to open-loop stimulation. The discussed experiments validate the proposed methodology and the software toolbox.},

In previous research, the computational properties of subthreshold oscillations and dynamic synapses have been studied separately. Our results show that dynamic synapses can influence different aspects of the dynamics of neuronal subthreshold oscillations. Factors such as maximum hyperpolarization level, oscillation amplitude and frequency or the resulting firing threshold are modulated by synaptic depression, which can even make subthreshold oscillations disappear. This influence reshapes the postsynaptic neuron's resonant properties arising from subthreshold oscillations and leads to specific input/output relations. We also study the neuron's response to another simultaneous input in the context of this modulation, and show a distinct contextual processing as a function of the depression, in particular for detection of signals through weak synapses. Intrinsic oscillations dynamics can be combined with the characteristic time scale of the modulatory input received by a dynamic synapse to build cost-effective cell/channel-specific information discrimination mechanisms, beyond simple resonances. In this regard, we discuss the functional implications of synaptic depression modulation on intrinsic subthreshold dynamics.},

The neural signatures consist of cell-specific spike timings in the bursting activity of the neurons. The role of these intraburst neural fingerprints is still unclear. It has been reported previously that some muscles can reflect small changes in the spike timings of the neurons that innervate them. However, it is unclear to what extent neural signatures contribute to the command message that the muscles receive from the motoneurons. It is also unknown whether the signatures have any functional meaning for the neurons that belong to the same CPG or to other interconnected CPGs. In this paper, we use realistic neural models to study the ability of single cells and small circuits to recognize individual neural signatures. We show that model cells and circuits can respond distinctly to the incoming neural fingerprints in addition to the properties of the slow depolarizing waves. Our results suggest that neural signatures can be a general mechanism of spiking-bursting cells to implement multicoding.},

The generation and modulation of coherent spiking activity in the IO is one key issue in cerebellar research. In this work, we build a large scale IO network model of electrically coupled conductance-based neurons to study the emerging spatio-temporal patterns of its transient neuronal activity. Our modeling reproduces and helps to understand important phenomena observed in IO in vitro and in vivo experiments, and draws new predictions regarding the computational properties of this network and the associated cerebellar circuits. The main factors studied governing the collective dynamics of the IO network were: the degree of electrical coupling, the extent of the electrotonic connections, the presence of stimuli or regions with different excitability levels and the modulatory effect of an inhibitory loop (IL). The spatio-temporal patterns were analyzed using a discrete wavelet transform to provide a quantitative characterization. Our results show that the electrotonic coupling produces quasi-synchronized subthreshold oscillations over a wide dynamical range. The synchronized oscillatory activity plays the role of a timer for a coordinated representation of spiking rhythms with different frequencies. The encoding and coexistence of several coordinated rhythms is related to the different clusterization and coherence of transient spatio-temporal patterns in the network, where the spiking activity is commensurate with the quasi-synchronized subthreshold oscillations. In the presence of stimuli, different rhythms are encoded in the spiking activity of the IO neurons that nevertheless remains constrained to a commensurate value of the subthreshold frequency. The stimuli induced spatio-temporal patterns can reverberate for long periods, which contributes to the computational properties of the IO. We also show that the presence of regions with different excitability levels creates sinks and sources of coordinated activity which shape the propagation of spike wave fronts. These results can be generalized beyond IO studies, as the control of wave pattern propagation is a highly relevant problem in the context of normal and pathological states in neural systems (e.g., related to tremor, migraine, epilepsy) where the study of the modulation of activity sinks and sources can have a potential large impact.},

  abstract = {Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) has emerged as one of the most powerful and widespread technologies to monitor the activity of neuronal networks in awake, behaving animals over long periods of time. MPM development spanned across decades and crucially depended on the concurrent improvement of calcium indicators that report neuronal activity as well as surgical protocols, head fixation approaches, and innovations in optics and microscopy technology. Here we review the last decade of MPM development and highlight how in vivo imaging has matured and diversified, making it now possible to concurrently monitor thousands of neurons across connected brain areas or, alternatively, small local networks with sampling rates in the kilohertz range. This review includes different laser scanning approaches, such as multibeam technologies as well as recent developments to image deeper into neuronal tissues using new, long-wavelength laser sources. As future development will critically depend on our ability to resolve and discriminate individual neuronal spikes, we will also describe a simple framework that allows performing quantitative comparisons between the reviewed MPM instruments. Finally, we provide our own opinion on how the most recent MPM developments can be leveraged at scale to enable the next generation of discoveries in brain function.},

We have cloned the C. elegans lin-4 locus by chromosomal walking and transformation rescue. We used the C. elegans clone to isolate the gene from three other Caenorhabditis species; all four Caenorhabditis clones functionally rescue the lin-4 null allele of C. elegans. Comparison of the lin-4 genomic sequence from these four species and site-directed mutagenesis of potential open reading frames indicated that lin-4 does not encode a protein. Two small lin-4 transcripts of approximately 22 and 61 nt were identified in C. elegans and found to contain sequences complementary to a repeated sequence element in the 3{$\prime$} untranslated region (UTR) of lin-14 mRNA, suggesting that lin-4 regulates lin-14 translation via an antisense RNA-RNA interaction.},

  abstract = {Sensory information reaches the cerebral cortex through the thalamus, which differentially relays this input depending on the state of arousal. Such 'gating' involves inhibition of the thalamocortical relay neurons by the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We reconstructed the thalamocortical circuit as an artificial and biological hybrid network in vitro. With visual input simulated as retinal cell activity, we show here that when the gain in the thalamic inhibitory feedback loop is greater than a critical value, the circuit tends towards oscillations -- and thus imposes a temporal decorrelation of retinal cell input and thalamic relay output. This results in the functional disconnection of the cortex from the sensory drive, a feature typical of sleep states. Conversely, low gain in the feedback inhibition and the action of noradrenaline, a known modulator of arousal, converge to increase input output correlation in relay neurons. Combining gain control of feedback inhibition and modulation of membrane excitability thus enables thalamic circuits to finely tune the gating of spike transmission from sensory organs to the cortex.}

  abstract = {Sensory input plays a major role in controlling motor responses during most behavioral tasks. The vestibular organs in the marine mollusk Clione, the statocysts, react to the external environment and continuously adjust the tail and wing motor neurons to keep the animal oriented vertically. However, we suggested previously that during hunting behavior, the intrinsic dynamics of the statocyst network produce a spatiotemporal pattern that may control the motor system independently of environmental cues. Once the response is triggered externally, the collective activation of the statocyst neurons produces a complex sequential signal. In the behavioral context of hunting, such network dynamics may be the main determinant of an intricate spatial behavior. Here, we show that (1) during fictive hunting, the population activity of the statocyst receptors is correlated positively with wing and tail motor output suggesting causality, (2) that fictive hunting can be evoked by electrical stimulation of the statocyst network, and (3) that removal of even a few individual statocyst receptors critically changes the fictive hunting motor pattern. These results indicate that the intrinsic dynamics of a sensory network, even without its normal cues, can organize a motor program vital for the survival of the animal.},

Reversible changes in the amplitude and kinetics of neuronal voltage-gated Na and K channel currents were recorded following irradiation with a single-mode 980 nm CNI-laser. Using single-channel recordings under controlled temperatures as a means of calibration, it was estimated that temperature at the neuron rose by 14{$^\circ$}C in 500 ms. Computer simulation confirmed that small temperature changes of about 5{$^\circ$}C were sufficient to produce significant changes in neuronal excitability. The method should be broadly applicable to studies of neuronal activity under physiological conditions, in particular studies of temperature-sensing neurons expressing thermoTRP channels. {\copyright} 2008 Humana Press Inc.},

In this Review, we~critically discuss the evidence on the long-term outcomes of DBS and consider the clinical implications. Although many patients are lost to follow-up, the evidence indicates that subthalamic nucleus DBS improves motor function for up to 10 years, although the magnitude of~improvement tends to decline over time. Functional scores recorded during on-medication periods worsen more quickly than those recorded in off periods, consistent with the degeneration of non-dopaminergic pathways. Dyskinesia, motor fluctuations and activities of~daily living in off periods remain improved at 5 years, but quality-of-life scores have usually fallen below preoperative levels. The incidence and severity of dementia among patients receiving DBS are comparable to those among patients who receive medical treatment. Severe~adverse events are rare, but adverse events such as dysarthria are common and probably under-reported. Long-term data on the outcomes of globus pallidus interna DBS are limited and mostly confirm the efficacy for dyskinesia. A trend towards offering DBS in the earlier stages of PD creates a need to identify factors that predict long-term outcomes and to discuss realistic expectations with patients preoperatively.},

  abstract = {Stochastic channel gating is the major source of intrinsic neuronal noise whose functional consequences at the microcircuit- and network-levels have been only partly explored. A systematic study of this channel noise in large ensembles of biophysically detailed model neurons calls for the availability of fast numerical methods. In fact, exact techniques employ the microscopic simulation of the random opening and closing of individual ion channels, usually based on Markov models, whose computational loads are prohibitive for next generation massive computer models of the brain. In this work, we operatively define a procedure for translating any Markov model describing voltage- or ligand-gated membrane ion-conductances into an effective stochastic version, whose computer simulation is efficient, without compromising accuracy. Our approximation is based on an improved Langevin-like approach, which employs stochastic differential equations and no Montecarlo methods. As opposed to an earlier proposal recently debated in the literature, our approximation reproduces accurately the statistical properties of the exact microscopic simulations, under a variety of conditions, from spontaneous to evoked response features. In addition, our method is not restricted to the Hodgkin-Huxley sodium and potassium currents and is general for a variety of voltage- and ligand-gated ion currents. As a by-product, the analysis of the properties emerging in exact Markov schemes by standard probability calculus enables us for the first time to analytically identify the sources of inaccuracy of the previous proposal, while providing solid ground for its modification and improvement we present here.},

New method: We have developed lcg, a software suite based on a command-line interface (CLI) that allows performing both standard and advanced electrophysiological experiments. Stimulation protocols for classical voltage and current clamp experiments are defined by a concise and flexible meta description that allows representing complex waveforms as a piece-wise parametric decomposition of elementary sub-waveforms, abstracting the stimulation hardware. To perform complex experiments lcg provides a set of elementary building blocks that can be interconnected to yield a large variety of experimental paradigms. Results: We present various cellular electrophysiological experiments in which lcg has been employed, ranging from the automated application of current clamp protocols for characterizing basic electrophysiological properties of neurons, to dynamic clamp, response clamp, and hybrid experiments. We finally show how the scripting capabilities behind a CLI are suited for integrating experimental trials into complex workflows, where actual experiment, online data analysis and computational modeling seamlessly integrate. Comparison with existing methods: We compare lcg with two open source toolboxes, RTXI and RELACS. Conclusions: We believe that lcg will greatly contribute to the standardization and reproducibility of both simple and complex experiments. Additionally, on the long run the increased efficiency due to a CLI will prove a great benefit for the experimental community. {\copyright}2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Recent applications range from the implementation of virtual reality systems for studying motor responses both in mice(1) and in zebrafish(2), to control of seizures following cortical stroke using optogenetics(3). A key advantage of closed-loop techniques resides in the capability of probing higher dimensional properties that are not directly accessible or that depend on multiple variables, such as neuronal excitability(4) and reliability, while at the same time maximizing the experimental throughput. In this contribution and in the context of cellular electrophysiology, we describe how to apply a variety of closed-loop protocols to the study of the response properties of pyramidal cortical neurons, recorded intracellularly with the patch clamp technique in acute brain slices from the somatosensory cortex of juvenile rats. As no commercially available or open source software provides all the features required for efficiently performing the experiments described here, a new software toolbox called LCG(5) was developed, whose modular structure maximizes reuse of computer code and facilitates the implementation of novel experimental paradigms. Stimulation waveforms are specified using a compact meta-description and full experimental protocols are described in text-based configuration files.

However, there are experiments from other labs that have not been able to reproduce these results. This has resulted in an ongoing controversy regarding the feasibility of infrared stimulation, and the reasons for these experimental differences still require explanation. The neural response characteristics also appear to be much different than with electrical stimulation. The electrical stimulation paradigms used for modern cochlear implants do not apply well to optical stimulation and new coding strategies are under development. Stimulation with infrared light brings the risk of heat accumulation in the tissue at high pulse repetition rates, so optimal pulse shapes and combined optical/electrical stimulation are being investigated to mitigate this. Optogenetics is another promising technique, which makes neurons more sensitive to light stimulation by inserting light sensitive ion channels via viral vectors. Challenges of optogenetics include the expression of light sensitive channels in sufficient density in the target neurons, and the risk of damaging neurons by the expression of a foreign protein. Conclusion: Optical stimulation of the nervous system is a promising new field, and there has been progress toward the development of a cochlear implant that takes advantage of the benefits of optical stimulation. There are barriers, and controversies, but so far none that seem intractable. Level of evidence: NA (animal studies and basic research).},

In part, this lack in understanding owes to the invasiveness of electrophysiological acquisition, the difficulty in their simultaneous recording over large cortical areas, and the absence of fully established methods for unbiased extraction of network information from these data. Here, we demonstrate a novel, data-driven approach to analyze spontaneous signal variations in electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings from nearly entire hemispheres of macaque monkeys. Based on both broadband analysis and analysis of specific frequency bands, the ECoG signals were found to co-vary in patterns that resembled the fMRI networks reported in previous studies. The extracted patterns were robust against changes in consciousness associated with sleep and anesthesia, despite profound changes in intrinsic characteristics of the raw signals, including their spectral signatures. These results suggest that the spatial organization of large-scale brain networks results from neural activity with a broadband spectral feature and is a core aspect of the brain's physiology that does not depend on the state of consciousness.},

In some of these cells the ionic conductances responsible for their excitability also endow them with autorhythmic electrical oscillatory properties. Chemical or electrical synaptic contacts between these neurons often result in network oscillations. In such networks, autorhythmic neurons may act as true oscillators (as pacemakers) or as resonators (responding preferentially to certain firing frequencies). Oscillations and resonance in the CNS are proposed to have diverse functional roles, such as (i) determining global functional states (for example, sleep-wakefulness or attention), (ii) timing in motor coordination, and (iii) specifying connectivity during development. Also, oscillation, especially in the thalamo-cortical circuits, may be related to certain neurological and psychiatric disorders. This review proposes that the autorhythmic electrical properties of central neurons and their connectivity form the basis for an intrinsic functional coordinate system that provides internal context to sensory input.},

  abstract = {Cochlear implants are currently the most effective solution for profound sensorineural hearing loss, and vestibular prostheses are under development to treat bilateral vestibulopathies. Electrical current spread in these neuroprostheses limits channel independence and, in some cases, may impair their performance. In comparison, optical stimuli that are spatially confined may result in a significant functional improvement. Pulsed infrared radiation (IR) has previously been shown to elicit responses in neurons. This study analyzes the response of neonatal rat spiral and vestibular ganglion neurons in vitro to IR (wavelength = 1,863 nm) using Ca2+imaging. Both types of neurons responded consistently with robust intracellular Ca2+([Ca2+]i) transients that matched the low-frequency IR pulses applied (4 ms, 0.25--1 pps). Radiant exposures of 637 mJ/cm2resulted in continual neuronal activation. Temperature or [Ca2+] variations in the media did not alter the IR-evoked transients, ruling out extracellular Ca2+involvement or primary mediation by thermal effects on the plasma membrane. While blockage of Na+, K+, and Ca2+plasma membrane channels did not alter the IR-evoked response, blocking of mitochondrial Ca2+cycling with CGP-37157 or ruthenium red reversibly inhibited the IR-evoked [Ca2+]itransients. Additionally, the magnitude of the IR-evoked transients was dependent on ryanodine and cyclopiazonic acid-dependent Ca2+release. These results suggest that IR modulation of intracellular calcium cycling contributes to stimulation of spiral and vestibular ganglion neurons. As a whole, the results suggest selective excitation of neurons in the IR beam path and the potential of IR stimulation in future auditory and vestibular prostheses.},

There were brief~bursts of narrow-band gamma oscillations (45-100~Hz), varied in time and frequency, accompanying encoding and re-activation of sensory information. They appeared at a minority of recording sites associated with spiking reflecting the to-be-remembered items. Beta oscillations (20-35~Hz) also occurred in brief, variable bursts but reflected a default state interrupted by encoding and decoding. Only activity of neurons reflecting encoding/decoding correlated with changes in gamma burst rate. Thus, gamma bursts could gate access to, and prevent sensory interference with, working memory. This supports the hypothesis that working memory is manifested by discrete oscillatory dynamics and spiking, not sustained activity.},

This article reviews the evidence for CPGs governing locomotion and addresses other factors, including supraspinal, sensory, and neuromodulatory influences, that interact with CPGs to shape the final motor output. Supraspinal inputs play a major role not only in initiating locomotion but also in adapting the locomotor pattern to environmental and motivational conditions. Sensory afferents involved in muscle and cutaneous reflexes have important regulatory functions in preserving balance and ensuring stable phase transitions in the locomotor cycle. Neuromodulators evoke changes in cellular and synaptic properties of CPG neurons, conferring flexibility to CPG circuits. Briefly addressed is the interaction of CPG networks to produce intersegmental coordination for locomotion. Evidence for CPGs in humans is reviewed, and although a comprehensive clinical review is not an objective, examples are provided of animal and human studies that apply knowledge of CPG mechanisms to improve locomotion. The final section deals with future directions in CPG research.},

  abstract = {Dopamine activates two different receptors to produce variability in sign at an identified synapse. Chemical synaptic transmission was investigated at a central synapse between identified neurons in the freshwater snail, Lymnaea stagnalis. The presynaptic neuron was the dopaminergic cell, Right Pedal Dorsal one (RPeD1). The postsynaptic neuron was Visceral Dorsal four (VD4). These neurons are components of the respiratory central pattern generator. The synapse from RPeD1 to VD4 showed variability of sign, i.e., it was either inhibitory (monophasic and hyperpolarizing), biphasic (depolarizing followed by hyperpolarizing phases), or undetectable. Both the inhibitory and biphasic synapse were eliminated by low Ca 2+ /high Mg 2+ saline and maintained in high Ca 2+ /high Mg 2+ saline, indicating that these two types of connections were chemical and monosynaptic. The latency of the inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) in high Ca 2+ /high Mg 2+ saline was {$\sim$}43 ms, whereas the biphasic postsynaptic potential (BPSP) had {$\sim$}12-ms latency in either normal or high Ca 2+ /high Mg 2+ saline. For a given preparation, when dopamine was pressured applied to the soma of VD4, it always elicited the same response as the synaptic input from RPeD1. Thus, for a VD4 neuron receiving an IPSP from RPeD1, pressure application of dopamine to the soma of VD4 produced an inhibitory response similar to the IPSP. The reversal potentials of the IPSP and the inhibitory dopamine response were both approximately -90 mV. For a VD4 neuron with a biphasic input from RPeD1, pressure-applied dopamine produced a biphasic response similar to the BPSP. The reversal potentials of the depolarizing phase of the BPSP and the biphasic dopamine response were both approximately -44 mV, whereas the reversal potentials for the hyperpolarizing phases were both approximately -90 mV. The hyperpolarizing but not the depolarizing phase of the BPSP and the biphasic dopamine response was blocked by the d-2 dopaminergic antagonist ({\textpm}) sulpiride. Previously, our laboratory demonstrated that both IPSP and the inhibitory dopamine response are blocked by ({\textpm}) sulpiride. Conversely, the depolarizing phase of both the BPSP and the biphasic dopamine response was blocked by the Cl - channel antagonist picrotoxin. Finally, both phases of the BPSP and the biphasic dopamine response were desensitized by continuous bath application of dopamine. These results indicate that the biphasic RPeD1 {$\rightarrow$} VD4 synapse is dopaminergic. Collectively, these data suggest that the variability in sign (inhibitory vs. biphasic) at the RPeD1 {$\rightarrow$} VD4 synapse is due to activation of two different dopamine receptors on the postsynaptic neuron VD4. This demonstrates that two populations of receptors can produce two different forms of transmission, i.e., the inhibitory and biphasic forms of the single RPeD1 {$\rightarrow$} VD4 synapse.},

Recent work has shown that precise delivery of infrared stimulation can modulate neural activity in a reversible manner. A possible mechanism underlying the excitatory effect of infrared stimulation is a localized elevation of temperature. To gain insight into how small elevations in temperature could potentially modulate neural activity, we explored the temperature sensitivity of the well-established Hodgkin-Huxley computational model of the squid giant axon. We relied on experimentally-derived temperature coefficients, or Q10 values, associated with gating kinetics for all the underlying currents and the maximum conductances, as well as the inherent temperature dependence of the equilibrium potentials of the ion conductances. While temperature elevations alone failed to induce action potentials in the computational model, small increases in temperature modulated the firing rate during constant current injection where greater than 30\% increase in spike rate was observed with 2{$^\circ$}C elevation in temperature. Furthermore, we observed that the rise in spike rate was largely due to the predicted temperature sensitivity of rate constants that form the basis of the gating parameters of the Hodgkin-Huxley computational model. Our findings suggest that the known biophysics of ion conductances may account, at least in part, for the excitatory effects of thermal elevations induced by exposure to infrared stimulation.},

Recent work on vertebrates highlights the importance of neuromodulatory control pathways in enabling spinal cord and brain stem circuits to generate meaningful motor patterns. Because rhythmic motor patterns are easily quantified and studied, central pattern generators will provide important testing grounds for understanding the effects of numerous genetic mutations on behavior. Moreover, further understanding of the modulation of spinal cord circuitry used in rhythmic behaviors should facilitate the development of new treatments to enhance recovery after spinal cord damage.},

The reconstruction uses cellular and synaptic organizing principles to algorithmically reconstruct detailed anatomy and physiology from sparse experimental data. An objective anatomical method defines a neocortical volume of 0.29 {\textpm} 0.01~mm3 containing {$\sim$}31,000 neurons, and patch-clamp studies identify 55 layer-specific morphological and 207 morpho-electrical neuron subtypes. When digitally reconstructed neurons are positioned in the volume and synapse formation is restricted to biological bouton densities and numbers of synapses per connection, their overlapping arbors form {$\sim$}8 million connections with {$\sim$}37 million synapses. Simulations reproduce an~array of in~vitro and in~vivo experiments without parameter tuning. Additionally, we find a spectrum of network states with a sharp transition from synchronous to asynchronous activity, modulated by physiological mechanisms. The spectrum of network states, dynamically reconfigured around this transition, supports diverse information processing strategies. PaperClip Video Abstract},

Such phase maintenance requires adjustment of synaptic input with network frequency, a relationship that we explored using the crab, Cancer borealis, pyloric network. The burst phase of pyloric neurons is relatively constant despite a {$>$} two fold variation in network frequency. We used noise input to characterize how input shape influences burst delay of a pyloric neuron, and then used dynamic clamp to examine how burst phase depends on the period, amplitude, duration, and shape of rhythmic synaptic input. Phase constancy across a range of periods required a proportional increase of synaptic duration with period. However, phase maintenance was also promoted by an increase of amplitude and peak phase of synaptic input with period. Mathematical analysis shows how short-term synaptic plasticity can coordinately change amplitude and peak phase to maximize the range of periods over which phase constancy is achieved.},

  abstract = {‚ñ™ Abstract A complete understanding of sensory and motor processing requires characterization of how the nervous system processes time in the range of tens to hundreds of milliseconds (ms). Temporal processing on this scale is required for simple sensory problems, such as interval, duration, and motion discrimination, as well as complex forms of sensory processing, such as speech recognition. Timing is also required for a wide range of motor tasks from eyelid conditioning to playing the piano. Here we review the behavioral, electrophysiological, and theoretical literature on the neural basis of temporal processing. These data suggest that temporal processing is likely to be distributed among different structures, rather than relying on a centralized timing area, as has been suggested in internal clock models. We also discuss whether temporal processing relies on specialized neural mechanisms, which perform temporal computations independent of spatial ones. We suggest that, given the intricate link between temporal and spatial information in most sensory and motor tasks, timing and spatial processing are intrinsic properties of neural function, and specialized timing mechanisms such as delay lines, oscillators, or a spectrum of different time constants are not required. Rather temporal processing may rely on state-dependent changes in network dynamics.},

CV1 interneurones produced facilitating excitatory postsynaptic potentials in N1 interneurones of the buccal central pattern generator for feeding. Connections with N2 interneurones were not found. 3. The CV1 population could be separated into two subgroups. CV1a received strong synaptic feedback in phase with the buccal rhythm, leading to strong bursting during generation of feeding motor output. CV1b received only weak feedback, and often fired continuously when depolarized. 4. Unitary inhibitory postsynaptic potentials were characteristic of all CV1 neurones, but were only visible in CV1b when it was depolarized. These inputs are thought to arise indirectly from the buccal central pattern generator. 5. The CV1 population is probably homologous with similar neurones in other gastropod species},

  abstract = {The present review discusses a well-established method for characterizing resting-state activity of the human brain using multichannel electroencephalography (EEG). This method involves the examination of electrical microstates in the brain, which are defined as successive short time periods during which the configuration of the scalp potential field remains semi-stable, suggesting quasi-simultaneity of activity among the nodes of large-scale networks. A few prototypic microstates, which occur in a repetitive sequence across time, can be reliably identified across participants. Researchers have proposed that these microstates represent the basic building blocks of the chain of spontaneous conscious mental processes, and that their occurrence and temporal dynamics determine the quality of mentation. Several studies have further demonstrated that disturbances of mental processes associated with neurological and psychiatric conditions manifest as changes in the temporal dynamics of specific microstates. Combined EEG-fMRI studies and EEG source imaging studies have indicated that EEG microstates are closely associated with resting-state networks as identified using fMRI. The scale-free properties of the time series of EEG microstates explain why similar networks can be observed at such different time scales. The present review will provide an overview of these EEG microstates, available methods for analysis, the functional interpretations of findings regarding these microstates, and their behavioral and clinical correlates.},

The results provide new insights into the relations between the functional properties of individual cells and the networks in which they are embedded. To our knowledge, this is the first model of the mitral-granule cell network to include a realistic representation of the experimentally-recorded complex spatial patterns elicited in the glomerular layer by natural odor stimulation. Although the olfactory bulb, due to its organization, has unique advantages with respect to other brain systems, the method is completely general, and can be integrated with more general approaches to other systems. The model makes experimentally testable predictions on distributed processing and on the differential backpropagation of somatic action potentials in each lateral dendrite following odor learning, providing a powerful three-dimensional framework for investigating the functions of brain microcircuits.},

  abstract = {The electrophysiological properties of the oblique branches of CA1 pyramidal neurons are largely unknown and very difficult to investigate experimentally. These relatively thin dendrites make up the majority of the apical tree surface area and constitute the main target of Schaffer collateral axons from CA3. Their electrogenic properties might have an important role in defining the computational functions of CA1 neurons. It is thus important to determine if and to what extent the back- and forward propagation of action potentials (AP) in these dendrites could be modulated by local properties such as morphology or active conductances. In the first detailed study of signal propagation in the full extent of CA1 oblique dendrites, we used 27 reconstructed three-dimensional morphologies and different distributions of the A-type K+ conductance (KA), to investigate their electrophysiological properties by computational modeling. We found that the local KA distribution had a major role in modulating action potential back propagation, whereas the forward propagation of dendritic spikes originating in the obliques was mainly affected by local morphological properties. In both cases, signal processing in any given oblique was effectively independent of the rest of the neuron and, by and large, of the distance from the soma. Moreover, the density of KA in oblique dendrites affected spike conduction in the main shaft. Thus the anatomical variability of CA1 pyramidal cells and their local distribution of voltage-gated channels may suit a powerful functional compartmentalization of the apical tree.

The first time one sees these nerve recordings on an oscilloscope screen, or hears the pattern on an audio monitor, a sense of amazement is experienced: the pyloric pattern is spontaneously generated information. The neurons in that dish are an incredibly sophisticated biological ``function generator'', and the immediate question is how does it all work? Could one ever hope to understand and explain the operation of this neural system at a mechanistic, cause-and-effect level? The purpose of this chapter is to attempt just such an explanation. First, as a basis for this discussion, the characteristics and variability of the pyloric burst pattern will be examined. In the following three sections, a review of pyloric mechanisms will be organized around three specific question: (1) Why do the pyloric cells fire in bursts of activity? (2) How are these bursts of activity coordinated to occur with the observed phase relationships? (3) What mechanisms determine the overall frequency of the motor pattern? Finally, we will integrate what we have learned about the circuitry, cellular and synaptic properties into a qualitative ``gestalt'' picture of pyloric pattern generation. A more quantitative description of pattern generation will be presented in Chapter 7.},

The existence of CPGs in humans is a matter of debate. Equally elusive is the contribution of CPGs to normal bipedal locomotion. To address these points, we focus on human studies that utilized spinal cord stimulation or pharmacological neuromodulation to generate rhythmic activity in individuals with spinal cord injury, and on neuromechanical modeling of human locomotion. In the absence of volitional motor control and step-specific sensory feedback, the human lumbar spinal cord can produce rhythmic muscle activation patterns that closely resemble CPG-induced neural activity of the isolated animal spinal cord. In this sense, CPGs in humans can be defined by the activity they produce. During normal locomotion, CPGs could contribute to the activation patterns during specific phases of the step cycle and simplify supraspinal control of step cycle frequency as a feedforward component to achieve a targeted speed. Determining how the human CPGs operate will be essential to advance the theory of neural control of locomotion and develop new locomotor neurorehabilitation paradigms.},

Yet, its applicability is limited in conditions of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) induced by, e.g., short exposure times and presence of opaque tissues. Herein this limitation is overcome by applying a U-shaped convolutional neural network (U-NET) to improve luminescence lifetime estimation under conditions of extremely low SNR. Specifically, the prowess of the U-NET is showcased in the context of luminescence lifetime thermometry, achieving more precise thermal readouts using Ag               2               S nanothermometers. Compared to traditional analysis methods of decay curve fitting and integration, the U-NET can extract average lifetimes more precisely and consistently regardless of the SNR value. The improvement achieved in the sensing performance using the U-NET is demonstrated with two experiments characterized by extreme measurement conditions: thermal monitoring of free-falling droplets, and monitoring of thermal transients in suspended droplets through an opaque medium. These results broaden the applicability of luminescence lifetime-based sensing in fields including in vivo experimentation and microfluidics, while, hopefully, spurring further research on the implementation of machine learning (ML) in luminescence sensing.},

  abstract = {We propose an optoelectronic system for stimulation of living neurons. The system consists of an electronic circuit based on the FitzHugh--Nagumo model, an optical fiber, and a photoelectrical converter. We used this system for electrical stimulation of hippocampal living neurons in acute hippocampal brain slices (350-\${$\mu\$$}m thick) obtained from a 20--28 days old C57BL/6 mouse or a Wistar rat. The main advantage of our system over other similar stimulators is that it contains an optical fiber for signal transmission instead of metallic wires. The fiber is placed between the electronic circuit and stimulated neurons and provides galvanic isolation from external electrical and magnetic fields. The use of the optical fiber allows avoiding electromagnetic noise and current flows which could affect metallic wires. Furthermore, it gives us the possibility to simulate ``synaptic plasticity'' by adaptive signal transfer through optical fiber. The proposed optoelectronic system (hybrid neural circuit) provides a very high efficiency in stimulating hippocampus neurons and can be used for restoring brain activity in particular regions or replacing brain parts (neuroprosthetics) damaged due to a trauma or neurodegenerative diseases.}

  abstract = {In the decade that followed the first modern demonstrations of neural central pattern generators, scientific milestones achieved by Hughes and Wiersma (1960) and D.M. Wilson (1961), many groups attempted to understand the mechanisms that generated particular motor patterns by analyzing the patterns themselves and by perturbing the nervous system in different ways. These were classic input-output analyses, whose main virtue was that they could be done and whose main weakness was that they could not distinguish between the host of alternative equivalent neural mechanisms that could generate the observed motor patterns. In that context, positive results from antidromic stimulation experiments (e.g., Mulloney 1970, Stein 1971) were exciting because they eliminated a class of alternative models. From the frustration that grew among students and scientists who tried to analyze neural mechanisms with the methods then available grew the idea that if the synaptic organization of the neurons involved could somehow be discovered, the mechanism that generated these enticing motor patterns could be explained and understood. D.M. Maynard's (1972) reports of the properties of the STG in various crustaceans were exciting because here was a nontrivial motor pattern generated by neurons from which we could record more than impulses. Perhaps this ganglion generated behaviors that physiologists could understand.},

The stimulation of mechano-receptor neurons is achieved through a large variety of devices that generate movement or vibration. In many situations, a hard real-time (RT) control of the device (in the millisecond time scale) is needed to produce realistic mechanical stimuli. The real-time control can be required to achieve the desired precision in the device or to implement activity-dependent stimulation protocols that imply the detection of physiological events to drive the stimulus in real time. In this paper we show that real-time software technology can be used to control stepper motors for mechano-receptor stimulation, and to implement artificial closed-loops to address the sensory-motor transformation. We illustrate this using as an example the control of a stepper motor to precisely move gravimetric organs in in vitro preparations.},

  abstract = {1. A simple inexpensive method is described for culturing L. s. appressa in large numbers in relatively small space through an indefinite number of generations. This method involves rearing the snails in three to ten liters of aerated water in deep covered glass jars located in subdued natural light, with approximately two adult snails to each liter of water. The water used is deep well water rich in calcium and magnesium and alkaline in reaction. The jars are cleaned and the water changed weekly, or bimonthly at the longest, and in winter the cold water is warmed to the prior temperature of the aquarium before the snails are placed in it. A small quantity of fine sand, used in trituration of food by the snail gizzard, is furnished in the aquaria. Loose green head lettuce leaves are kept available in the aquaria most of the time; and weekly, wheat cereal cooked in milk and supplemented by a mixture of balanced salts is added. 2. Prehatching mortality by this method is negligible. Sexual maturity is reached in about three months and the average final length of snails reached is between fifty and fifty-five mm. The longest snail ever cultured attained a length of 62.5 mm. The maximum life span of the snail under these cultural conditions is fourteen months. 3. Observations on crawling and feeding, movements concerned with respiration, overcrowding, copulation, oviposition and egg production, gross embryology, hatching, exchange of water for air in the lung, desiccation, etc., are recorded. 4. Egg production was approximately doubled by the addition of cooked wheat cereal to the normal lettuce diet. Non-copulating snails, kept in solitary culture through their sexually mature existence, laid a greater number of eggs per snail than copulating snails living in a group. Snails kept in group culture started ovipositing sooner than in solitary culture. In individual snails the maximum length of egg masses per day increased sharply shortly after egg laying commenced, reached a peak somewhere in the middle of the egg laying period and then gradually tapered at the end. Oviposition in snails kept in solitary culture occurred in periods of variable duration alternating with rest periods.},

  abstract = {Oscillatory neurons integrate their synaptic inputs in fundamentally different ways than normally quiescent neurons. We show that the oscillation period of invertebrate endogenous pacemaker neurons wanders, producing random fluctuations in the interspike intervals (ISI) on a time scale of seconds to minutes, which decorrelates pairs of neurons in hybrid circuits constructed using the dynamic clamp. The autocorrelation of the ISI sequence remained high for many ISIs, but the autocorrelation of the {$\Delta$}ISI series had on average a single nonzero value, which was negative at a lag of one interval. We reproduced these results using a simple integrate and fire (IF) model with a stochastic population of channels carrying an adaptation current with a stochastic component that was integrated with a slow time scale, suggesting that a similar population of channels underlies the observed wander in the period. Using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, we found that a single integrator and a single moving average with a negative coefficient could simulate both the experimental data and the IF model. Feeding white noise into an integrator with a slow time constant is sufficient to produce the autocorrelation structure of the ISI series. Moreover, the moving average clearly accounted for the autocorrelation structure of the {$\Delta$}ISI series and is biophysically implemented in the IF model using slow stochastic adaptation. The observed autocorrelation structure may be a neural signature of slow stochastic adaptation, and wander generated in this manner may be a general mechanism for limiting episodes of synchronized activity in the nervous system.},

  abstract = {Many species of cold-blooded animals experience substantial and rapid fluctuations in body temperature. Because biological processes are differentially temperature dependent, it is difficult to understand how physiological processes in such animals can be temperature robust [1--8]. Experiments have shown that core neural circuits, such as the pyloric circuit of the crab stomatogastric ganglion (STG), exhibit robust neural activity in spite of large (20{$^\circ$}C) temperature fluctuations [3, 5, 7, 8]. This robustness is surprising because (1) each neuron has many different kinds of ion channels with different temperature dependencies (Q10s) that interact in a highly nonlinear way to produce firing patterns and (2) across animals there is substantial variability in conductance densities that nonetheless produce almost identical firing properties. The high variability in conductance densities in these neurons [9, 10] appears to contradict the possibility that robustness is achieved through precise tuning of key temperature-dependent processes. In this paper, we develop a theoretical explanation for how temperature robustness can emerge from a simple regulatory control mechanism that is compatible with highly variable conductance densities [11--13]. The resulting model suggests a general mechanism for how nervous systems and excitable tissues can exploit degenerate relationships among temperature-sensitive processes to achieve robust function.},

  abstract = {Background: The phenomena that emerge from the interaction of the stochastic opening and closing of ion channels (channel noise) with the non-linear neural dynamics are essential to our understanding of the operation of the nervous system. The effects that channel noise can have on neural dynamics are generally studied using numerical simulations of stochastic models. Algorithms based on discrete Markov Chains (MC) seem to be the most reliable and trustworthy, but even optimized algorithms come with a non-negligible computational cost. Diffusion Approximation (DA) methods use Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) to approximate the behavior of a number of MCs, considerably speeding up simulation times. However, model comparisons have suggested that DA methods did not lead to the same results as in MC modeling in terms of channel noise statistics and effects on excitability. Recently, it was shown that the difference arose because MCs were modeled with coupled gating particles, while the DA was modeled using uncoupled gating particles. Implementations of DA with coupled particles, in the context of a specific kinetic scheme, yielded similar results to MC. However, it remained unclear how to generalize these implementations to different kinetic schemes, or whether they were faster than MC algorithms. Additionally, a steady state approximation was used for the stochastic terms, which, as we show here, can introduce significant inaccuracies.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of activity bursts in the early preterm EEG, to assess inter-rater agreement of burst detection by visual inspection, and to determine the performance of an automated burst detector that uses non-linear energy operator (NLEO). METHODS: EEG recordings from extremely preterm (n=12) and very preterm (n=6) infants were analysed. Three neurophysiologists independently marked bursts in the EEG, the characteristics of bursts were analyzed and inter-rater agreement determined. Unanimous detections were used as the gold standard in estimating the performance of an automated burst detector. In addition, some details of this automated detector were revised in an attempt to improve performance. RESULTS: Overall, inter-rater agreement was 86\% for extremely preterm infants and 81\% for very preterm infants. In visual markings, bursts had variable lengths (approximately 1-10s) and increased amplitudes (and power) throughout the frequency spectrum. Accuracy of the original detection algorithm was 87\% and 79\% and accuracy of the revised algorithm 93\% and 87\% for extremely preterm and very preterm babies, respectively. CONCLUSION: Visual detection of bursts from the early preterm EEG is comparable albeit not identical between raters. The original automated detector underestimates the amount of burst occurrence, but can be readily improved to yield results comparable to visual detection. Further clinical studies are warranted to assess the optimal descriptors of burst detection for monitoring and prognostication. SIGNIFICANCE: Validation of a burst detector offers an evidence-based platform for further development of brain monitors in very preterm babies.},

  abstract = {Background: Modulation of brain circuits by electrical stimulation has led to exciting and powerful therapies for diseases such as Parkinson's. Because human brain organization is based in mesoscale (millimeter-scale) functional nodes, having a method that can selectively target such nodes could enable more precise, functionally specific stimulation therapies. Infrared Neural Stimulation (INS) is an emerging stimulation technology that stimulates neural tissue via delivery of tiny heat pulses. In nonhuman primates, this optical method provides focal intensity-dependent stimulation of the brain without tissue damage. However, whether INS application to the human central nervous system (CNS) is similarly effective is unknown. Objective: To examine the effectiveness of INS on human cerebral cortex in intraoperative setting and to evaluate INS damage threshholds. Methods: Five epileptic subjects undergoing standard lobectomy for epilepsy consented to this study. Cortical response to INS was assessed by intrinsic signal optical imaging (OI, a method that detects changes in tissue reflectance due to neuronal activity). A custom integrated INS and OI system was developed specifically for short-duration INS and OI acquisition during surgical procedures. Single pulse trains of INS with intensities from 0.2 to 0.8 J/cm2 were delivered to the somatosensory cortex and responses were recorded via optical imaging. Following tissue resection, histological analysis was conducted to evaluate damage threshholds. Results: As assessed by OI, and similar to results in monkeys, INS induced responses in human cortex were highly focal (millimeter sized) and led to relative suppression of nearby cortical sites. Intensity dependence was observed at both stimulated and functionally connected sites. Histological analysis of INS-stimulated human cortical tissue provided damage threshold estimates. Conclusion: This is the first study demonstrating application of INS to human CNS and shows feasibility for stimulating single cortical nodes and associated sites and provided INS damage threshold estimates for cortical tissue. Our results suggest that INS is a promising tool for stimulation of functionally selective mesoscale circuits in the human brain, and may lead to advances in the future of precision medicine.},

  abstract = {This study examined whether electrophysiological changes in the endogenous properties and connectivity of the modulatory serotonergic cerebral giant cells (CGCs) contributed to the age-related changes in feeding behavior of the pond snail, Lymnaea. With increasing age there was a decrease in spontaneous CGC firing rates and decreased excitability of the CGCs to both chemosensory stimulation (0.05 M sucrose applied to the lips) and direct intracellular current injection. These changes could be accounted for by a decrease in the input resistance of the neuron and an increase in the amplitude and the duration of the after-hyperpolarization. Decreases were also seen in the \% of CGC pairs that were electrically coupled causing asynchronous firing. Together these changes would tend to reduce the ability of the CGCs to gate and control the frequency of the feeding behavior. Part of the ability of the CGCs to gate and frequency control the feeding network is to provide a background level of excitation to the feeding motor neurons. Recordings from B1 and B4 motor neurons showed an age-related hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential consistent with a deficit in CGC function. Increases were seen in the strength of the evoked CGC {$\rightarrow$} B1 connection, however, this increase failed to compensate for the deficits in CGC excitability. In summary, age-related changes in the properties of the CGCs were consistent with them contributing to the age-related changes in feeding behavior seen in Lymnaea. {\copyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Converging evidence supports the notion that, precisely because of its importance across a wide range of brain functions, timing relies on intrinsic and general properties of neurons and neural circuits; that is, the brain uses its natural cellular and network dynamics to solve a diversity of temporal computations. Many circuits have been shown to encode elapsed time in dynamically changing patterns of neural activity---so-called population clocks. But temporal processing encompasses a wide range of different computations, and just as there are different circuits and mechanisms underlying computations about space, there are a multitude of circuits and mech-anisms underlying the ability to tell time and generate temporal patterns.}

Reciprocal activity in levator and depressor motoneurones can be evoked, or occurs spontaneously, in the partially de-afferented preparations, thus indicating the existence of a central locomotory rhythm generator. 3. The reciprocal activity patterns recorded in the same motoneurones in intact freely moving animals are not identical to those recorded in partially de-afferented preparations. Thus, the production of normal rhythmic leg movements depends to some extent on sensory input from leg receptors, this input probably exerting tonic and phasic effects on the central rhythm generator. 4. An increase in the resistance to leg retraction during normal walking results in an increase in discharge rate of the levator and depressor motoneurones. This observation further demonstrates that rhythmic leg movements are not exclusively centrally con- trolled. The receptors responsible for this reflex effect are probably the trochanteral campaniform sensilla.},

  abstract = {To study the effects of stochastic ion channel fluctuations on neural dynamics, several numerical implementation methods have been proposed. Gillespie's method for Markov Chains (MC) simulation is highly accurate, yet it becomes computationally intensive in the regime of a high number of channels. Many recent works aim to speed simulation time using the Langevin-based Diffusion Approximation (DA). Under this common theoretical approach, each implementation differs in how it handles various numerical difficulties---such as bounding of state variables to [0,1]. Here we review and test a set of the most recently published DA implementations (Goldwyn et al., 2011; Linaro et al., 2011; Dangerfield et al., 2012; Orio and Soudry, 2012; Schmandt and Gal{\'a}n, 2012; G{\"u}ler, 2013; Huang et al., 2013a), comparing all of them in a set of numerical simulations that assess numerical accuracy and computational efficiency on three different models: (1) the original Hodgkin and Huxley model, (2) a model with faster sodium channels, and (3) a multi-compartmental model inspired in granular cells. We conclude that for a low number of channels (usually below 1000 per simulated compartment) one should use MC---which is the fastest and most accurate method. For a high number of channels, we recommend using the method by Orio and Soudry (2012), possibly combined with the method by Schmandt and Gal{\'a}n (2012) for increased speed and slightly reduced accuracy. Consequently, MC modeling may be the best method for detailed multicompartment neuron models---in which a model neuron with many thousands of channels is segmented into many compartments with a few hundred channels.},

  abstract = {We have developed a two-compartment, eight-variable model of a CA3 pyramidal cell as a reduction of a complex 19-compartment cable model [Traub et al, 1991]. Our reduced model segregates the fast currents for sodium spiking into a proximal, soma-like, compartment and the slower calcium and calcium-mediated currents into a dendrite-like compartment. In each model periodic bursting gives way to repetitive soma spiking as somatic injected current increases. Steady dendritic stimulation can produce periodic bursting of significantly higher frequency (8--20 Hz) than can steady somatic input ({$<$}8 Hz). Bursting in our model occurs only for an intermediate range of electronic coupling conductance. It depends on the segregation of channel types and on the coupling current that flows back-and-forth between compartments. When the soma and dendrite are tightly coupled electrically, our model reduces to a single compartment and does not burst. Network simulations with our model using excitatory AMPA and NMDA synapses (without inhibition) give results similar to those obtained with the complex cable model [Traub et al, 1991; Traub et al, 1992]. Brief stimulation of a single cell in a resting network produces multiple synchronized population bursts, with fast AMPA synapses providing the dominant synchronizing mechanism. The number of bursts increases with the level of maximal NMDA conductance. For high enough maximal NMDA conductance synchronized bursting repeats indefinitely. We find that two factors can cause the cells to desynchronize when AMPA synapses are blocked: heterogeneity of properties amongst cells and intrinsically chaotic burst dynamics. But even when cells are identical, they may synchronize only approximately rather than exactly. Since our model has a limited number of parameters and variables, we have studied its cellular and network dynamics computationally with relative ease and over wide parameter ranges. Thereby, we identify some qualitative features that parallel or are distinguished from those of other neuronal systems; e.g., we discuss how bursting here differs from that in some classical models.},

Specifically, rapid temperature pulses were shown to increase membrane capacitance, causing capacitive currents that explain neural excitation, but the underlying biophysics is not well understood. Here, we show that an intramembrane thermal-mechanical effect wherein the phospholipid bilayer undergoes axial narrowing and lateral expansion accurately predicts a potentially universal thermal capacitance increase rate of {$\sim$}0.3\%/{$^\circ$}C. This capacitance increase and concurrent changes in the surface charge related fields lead to predictable exciting ionic displacement currents. The new MechanoElectrical Thermal Activation theory's predictions provide an excellent agreement with multiple experimental results and indirect estimates of latent biophysical quantities. Our results further highlight the role of electro-mechanics in neural excitation; they may also help illuminate subthreshold and novel physical cellular effects, and could potentially lead to advanced new methods for neural control.},

The intrinsic electrophysiological properties of cortical neurons were analyzed from several preparations, and we selected the four most prominent electrophysiological classes of neurons. These four classes are ``fast spiking'' ``regular spiking'' ``intrinsically bursting'' and ``low-threshold spike'' cells. For each class, we fit ``minimal'' HH type models to experimental data. The models contain the minimal set of voltage-dependent currents to account for the data. To obtain models as generic as possible, we used data from different preparations in vivo and in vitro, such as rat somatosensory cortex and thalamus, guinea-pig visual and frontal cortex, ferret visual cortex, cat visual cortex and cat association cortex. For two cell classes, we used automatic fitting procedures applied to several cells, which revealed substantial cell-to-cell variability within each class. The selection of such cellular models constitutes a necessary step towards building network simulations of the thalamocortical system with realistic cellular dynamical properties.},

In parallel, modeling has been established as a tool to relate network structure to activity dynamics. While available comprehensive connectivity maps ( Thomson, West, et al. 2002; Binzegger et al. 2004) have been used in various computational studies, prominent features of the simulated activity such as the spontaneous firing rates do not match the experimental findings. Here, we analyze the properties of these maps to compile an integrated connectivity map, which additionally incorporates insights on the specific selection of target types. Based on this integrated map, we build a full-scale spiking network model of the local cortical microcircuit. The simulated spontaneous activity is asynchronous irregular and cell-type specific firing rates are in agreement with in vivo recordings in awake animals, including the low rate of layer 2/3 excitatory cells. The interplay of excitation and inhibition captures the flow of activity through cortical layers after transient thalamic stimulation. In conclusion, the integration of a large body of the available connectivity data enables us to expose the dynamical consequences of the cortical microcircuitry.},

Here we review important neural parallels between birdsong and speech. In both cases there are separate but continually interacting neural networks that underlie vocal production, sensorimotor learning, and auditory perception and memory. As in the case of human speech, neural activity related to birdsong learning is lateralized, and mirror neurons linking perception and performance may contribute to sensorimotor learning. In songbirds that are learning their songs, there is continual interaction between secondary auditory regions and sensorimotor regions, similar to the interaction between Wernicke's and Broca's areas in human infants acquiring speech and language. Taken together, song learning in birds and speech acquisition in humans may provide useful insights into the evolution and mechanisms of auditory-vocal learning.},

  abstract = {Cortical neuroscience is founded on studies of a very few model organisms, mainly rats, cats, and macaque monkeys. The concentration of effort on such a few species would be defensible if cortical organization were basically uniform across mammals, as is commonly believed. Although there is little reason to doubt that some features of cortical organization are indeed widespread among mammals, phyletic variation in cortical organization is far more extensive than has generally been appreciated or acknowledged. Rats, for example, differ from other mammals in the genetics and chemistry of their cortical neurons, in connectivity and areal organization, and in the functions of specific cortical regions. Likewise, macaque monkeys, although widely used as models of the human visual system, lack a number of features found in human visual cortex. Given the variability of cortical organization, how should neuroscientists approach the study of nonhuman species, and what can we reasonably expect to learn from them? First, by examining a wider range of species than are currently employed, and by using modern techniques of phyletic analysis, neuroscientists can more rigorously identify those features of cortical organization that are, in fact, widely shared among mammals or among particular mammalian subgroups. Second, by taking account of variations, neuroscientists can abstract more reliable and general principles of structure-function relationships in the nervous system. Finally, freed from the doctrine of basic uniformity, neuroscientists can pursue the study of human cortical specializations, and so advance our understanding of what distinguishes humans as a biological species.},

We recorded whole cell currents in mammalian type II vestibular hair cells using an excised preparation (mouse) and action potentials (APs) in afferent neurons in vivo (chinchilla) in response to optical heat pulses applied to the crista ({$\Delta$} T {$\approx$} 0.25{$^\circ$}C per pulse). Afferent spike trains evoked by heat pulse stimuli were diverse and included asynchronous inhibition, asynchronous excitation, and/or phase-locked APs synchronized to each infrared heat pulse. Thermal responses of membrane currents responsible for APs in ganglion neurons were strictly excitatory, with Q \textsubscript{10} {$\approx$} 2. In contrast, hair cells responded with a mix of excitatory and inhibitory currents. Excitatory hair cell membrane currents included a thermoelectric capacitive current proportional to the rate of temperature rise (d T/d t) and an inward conduction current driven by {$\Delta$} T. An iberiotoxin-sensitive inhibitory conduction current was also evoked by {$\Delta$} T, rising in \&lt;3 ms and decaying with a time constant of {$\sim$}24 ms. The inhibitory component dominated whole cell currents in 50\% of hair cells at -68 mV and in 67\% of hair cells at -60 mV. Responses were quantified and described on the basis of first principles of thermodynamics. Results identify key molecular targets underlying heat pulse excitability in vestibular sensory organs and provide quantitative methods for rational application of optical heat pulses to examine protein biophysics and manipulate cellular excitability. {$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Discrete sequential information coding is a key mechanism that transforms complex cognitive brain activity into a low-dimensional dynamical process based on the sequential switching among finite numbers of patterns. The storage size of the corresponding process is large because of the permutation capacity as a function of control signals in ensembles of these patterns. Extracting low-dimensional functional dynamics from multiple large-scale neural populations is a central problem both in neuro-and cognitive-sciences. Experimental results in the last decade represent a solid base for the creation of low-dimensional models of different cognitive functions and allow moving toward a dynamical theory of consciousness. We discuss here a methodology to build simple kinetic equations that can be the mathematical skeleton of this theory. Models of the corresponding discrete information processing can be designed using the following dynamical principles: (i) clusterization of the neural activity in space and time and formation of information patterns; (ii) robustness of the sequential dynamics based on heteroclinic chains of metastable clusters; and (iii) sensitivity of such sequential dynamics to intrinsic and external informational signals. We analyze sequential discrete coding based on winnerless competition low-frequency dynamics. Under such dynamics, entrainment, and heteroclinic coordination leads to a large variety of coding regimes that are invariant in time.},

  abstract = {Dynamical modeling of neural systems and brain functions has a hist ory of success over the last half century. This includes, for example, the explanation and prediction of some features of neural rhythmic behaviors. Many interesting dynamical models of learning and memory based on physiological experiments have been suggested over the last two decades. Dynamical models even of consciousness now exist. Usually these models and results are based on traditional approaches and paradigms of nonlinear dynamics including dynamical chaos. Neural systems are, however, an unusual subject for nonlinear dynamics for several reasons: (i) Even the simplest neural network, with only a few neurons and synaptic connections, has an enormous number of variables and control parameters. These make neural systems adaptive and flexible, and are critical to their biological function. (ii) In contrast to traditional physical systems described by well-known basic principles, first principles governing the dynamics of neural systems are unknown. (iii) Many different neural systems exhibit similar dynamics despite having different architectures and different levels of complexity. (iv) The network architecture and connection strengths are usually not known in detail and therefore the dynamical analysis must, in some sense, be probabilistic. (v) Since nervous systems are able to organize behavior based on sensory inputs, the dynamical modeling of these systems has to explain the transformation of temporal information into combinatorial or combinatorial-temporal codes, and vice versa, for memory and recognition. In this review these problems are discussed in the context of addressing the stimulating questions: What can neuroscience learn from nonlinear dynamics, and what can nonlinear dynamics learn from neuroscience?}

The model describes the coordination of spatio-temporal patterns in the form of sequential switchings corresponding to different modalities. We formulate the conditions for the existence of a multimodality heteroclinic sequence (MHS) in the phase space of this model. Such a sequence appears due to inhibitory connections between different sensory networks that implement a winnerless competition interaction. Computer simulations illustrate the robustness of the switching of the coordinated sequences for different modalities and their mutual regularization and modulation. {\copyright}2010 Taylor \& Francis.},

Such cognitive spatio-temporal processes can be represented by a set of sequential metastable dynamical states together with their associated transitions: The state is quasi-stationary close to one metastable state before a rapid transition to another state. Hence, we postulate that metastable states are the central players in cognitive information processing. Based on the analogy of quasiparticles as elementary units in physics, we introduce here the quantum of cognitive information dynamics, which we term ``cognon''. A cognon, or dynamical unit of thought, is represented by a robust finite chain of metastable neural states. Cognons can be organized at multiple hierarchical levels and coordinate complex cognitive information representations. Since a cognon is an abstract conceptualization, we link this abstraction to brain sequential dynamics that can be measured using common modalities and argue that cognons and brain rhythms form binding spatiotemporal complexes to keep simultaneous dynamical information which relate the `what', `where' and `when'.},

Such events compose sequences: linguistic, episodic memory, motor behavior, etc., whose dynamics are robust, reproducible, and sensitively react to incoming informational signals. The human mind is able to process, understand and predict time-dependent information about the environment and about ourselves, and generate corresponding commands to control behavior. Many experiments have indicated that the mind relies on sequential dynamics to carry out these tasks. Based on brain imaging experiments, we discuss here a set of key principles and their instantiation in nonlinear differential equations to form a dynamical theory of consciousness and creativity. General hierarchical models of consciousness and creativity include coupled low-dimensional equations that govern cooperative variables for several cognitive modalities: episodic (semantic) memory, working memory, attention, emotion, perception and their sequential interaction. In the phase spaces spanned by variables of these models, the joint transient dynamics of cognitive modalities is represented by coupled heteroclinic networks which share complex metastable states. The interaction of such states is responsible for the robustness of transient neural dynamics involved in the generation of thoughts and in the programming of behavior. In the framework of the analyzed dynamical models, we discuss the interaction of cognitive processes and the generation of new information in creativity.},

Our results show that the burst periods and the phase lags between the constrictor (LP) and dilator (PD) neurons across preparations showed significant variability during equivalent experimental manipulations. Despite this variability, the ratio between the change in the burst period and the change in the phase lag between the same neurons was tightly preserved in all preparations, revealing a dynamical invariant in the system. This dynamical invariant was preserved despite the individual variability in the period and phase lag measurements, suggesting a tightly regulated constraint between the parameters of the network. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag 2007.},

Hybrid networks are also a necessary step to build effective artificial intelligence and brain hybridization. In this work, we deal with the automatized online and offline adaptation, exploration and parameter mapping to achieve a target dynamics in hybrid circuits and, in particular, those that yield dynamical invariants between living and model neurons. We address dynamical invariants that form robust cycle-by-cycle relationships between the intervals that build neural sequences from such interaction. Our methodology first attains automated adaptation of model neurons to work in the same amplitude regime and time scale of living neurons. Then, we address the automatized exploration and mapping of the synapse parameter space that lead to a specific dynamical invariant target. Our approach uses multiple configurations and parallel computing from electrophysiological recordings of living neurons to build full mappings, and genetic algorithms to achieve an instance of the target dynamics of the hybrid circuit in a short time. We illustrate and validate such strategy in the context of the study of functional sequences in neural rhythms, which can be easily generalized for any variety of hybrid circuit configuration. This approach facilitates both the building of hybrid circuits and the accomplishment of their scientific goal.},

  abstract = {Electrical stimulation has been used for decades in devices such as pacemakers, cochlear implants and more recently for deep brain and retinal stimulation and electroceutical treatment of disease. However, current spread from the electrodes limits the precision of neural activation, leading to a low quality therapeutic outcome or undesired side-effects. Alternative methods of neural stimulation such as optical stimulation offer the potential to deliver higher spatial resolution of neural activation. Direct optical stimulation is possible with infrared light, while visible light can be used to activate neurons if the neural tissue is genetically modified with a light sensitive ion channel. Experimentally, both methods have resulted in highly precise stimulation with little spread of activation at least in the cochlea, each with advantages and disadvantages. Infrared neural stimulation does not require modification of the neural tissue, but has very high power requirements. Optogenetics can achieve precision of activation with lower power, but only in conjunction with targeted insertion of a light sensitive ion channel into the nervous system via gene therapy. This review will examine the advantages and limitations of optical stimulation of neural tissue, using the cochlea as an exemplary model and recent developments for retinal and deep brain stimulation.},

  abstract = {The crab Cancer borealis undergoes large daily fluctuations in environmental temperature (8-24uC) and must maintain appropriate neural function in the face of this perturbation. In the pyloric circuit of the crab stomatogastric ganglion, we pharmacologically isolated the pacemaker kernel (the AB and PD neurons) and characterized its behavior in response to temperature ramps from 7uC to 31uC. For moderate temperatures, the pacemaker displayed a frequency-temperature curve statistically indistinguishable from that of the intact circuit, and like the intact circuit maintained a constant duty cycle. At high temperatures (above 23uC), a variety of different behaviors were seen: in some preparations the pacemaker increased in frequency, in some it slowed, and in many preparations the pacemaker stopped oscillating (''crashed''). Furthermore, these crashes seemed to fall into two qualitatively different classes. Additionally, the animal-to-animal variability in frequency increased at high temperatures. We used a series of Morris-Lecar mathematical models to gain insight into these phenomena. The biophysical components of the final model have temperature sensitivities similar to those found in nature, and can crash via two qualitatively different mechanisms that resemble those observed experimentally. The crash type is determined by the precise parameters of the model at the reference temperature, 11uC, which could explain why some preparations seem to crash in one way and some in another. Furthermore, even models with very similar behavior at the reference temperature diverge greatly at high temperatures, resembling the experimental observations.},

L. stagnalis, as a model, provides an interesting platform to investigate the dialog between the synapse and the nucleus and vice versa during memory and learning. More importantly, the ``molecular actors'' of the memory dialogue are well-conserved both across phylogenetic groups and learning paradigms, involving single- or multi-trials, aversion or reward, operant or classical conditioning. At the same time, this model could help to study how, where and when the memory dialog is impaired in stressful conditions and during aging and neurodegeneration in humans and thus offers new insights and targets in order to develop innovative therapies and technology for the treatment of a range of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders.},

  abstract = {Multiple extracellular microelectrodes (multi-electrode arrays, or MEAs) effectively record rapidly varying neural signals, and can also be used for electrical stimulation. Multi-electrode recording can serve as artificial output (efferents) from a neural system, while complex spatially and temporally targeted stimulation can serve as artificial input (afferents) to the neuronal network. Multi-unit or local field potential (LFP) recordings can not only be used to control real world artifacts, such as prostheses, computers or robots, but can also trigger or alter subsequent stimulation. Real-time feedback stimulation may serve to modulate or normalize aberrant neural activity, to induce plasticity, or to serve as artificial sensory input. Despite promising closed-loop applications, commercial electrophysiology systems do not yet take advantage of the bidirectional capabilities of multi-electrodes, especially for use in freely moving animals. We addressed this lack of tools for closing the loop with NeuroRighter, an open-source system including recording hardware, stimulation hardware, and control software with a graphical user interface. The integrated system is capable of multi-electrode recording and simultaneous patterned microstimulation (triggered by recordings) with minimal stimulation artifact. The potential applications of closed-loop systems as research tools and clinical treatments are broad; we provide one example where epileptic activity recorded by a multi-electrode probe is used to trigger targeted stimulation, via that probe, to freely moving rodents.},

  abstract = {Synaptic dynamics differ markedly across connections and strongly regulate how action potentials are being communicated. To model the range of synaptic dynamics observed in experiments, we develop a flexible mathematical framework based on a linear-nonlinear operation. This model can capture various experimentally observed features of synaptic dynamics and different types of heteroskedasticity. Despite its conceptual simplicity, we show it is more adaptable than previous models. Combined with a standard maximum likelihood approach, synaptic dynamics can be accurately and efficiently characterized using naturalistic stimulation patterns. These results make explicit that synaptic processing bears algorithmic similarities with information processing in convolutional neural networks. Author summary Understanding how information is transmitted relies heavily on knowledge of the underlying regulatory synaptic dynamics. Existing computational models for capturing such dynamics are often either very complex or too restrictive. As a result, effectively capturing the different types of dynamics observed experimentally remains a challenging problem. Here, we propose a mathematically flexible linear-nonlinear model that is capable of efficiently characterizing synaptic dynamics. We demonstrate the ability of this model to capture different features of experimentally observed data.}

We examined whether other mechanisms besides the escape and release mechanisms might be needed for some cases of reciprocal inhibition, and show that, within the confines of a simple two-dimensional cell model, escape and release are sufficient for all cases. We divided the behaviors of a single cell into six different types and examined the joint behaviors arising from every combination of pairs of cells with behaviors drawn from these six types. For the case of two quiescent cells or two cells each having plateau potentials, bifurcation diagrams demonstrate the relations between synaptic threshold and synaptic strength necessary for oscillations by escape, oscillations by release, or network-generated plateau potentials. Thus we clarify the relationship between plateau potentials and oscillations in a cell. Using the two dimensional cell model we examine 1:N beating between cells and find that our simple model displays many of the essential dynamical properties displayed by more sophisticated models, some of which relate to thalamocortical spindling.},

  abstract = {Dynamic clamp is a powerful approach for electrophysiological investigations allowing researchers to introduce artificial electrical components into target neurons to simulate ionic conductances, chemical or electrotonic inputs or connections to other cells. Due to the rapidly changing and potentially large current injections during dynamic clamp, problematic voltage artifacts appear on the electrode used to inject dynamic clamp currents into a target neuron. Dynamic clamp experiments, therefore, typically use two separate electrodes in the same cell, one for recording membrane potential and one for injecting currents. The requirement for two independent electrodes has been a limiting factor for the use of dynamic clamp in applications where dual recordings of this kind are difficult or impossible to achieve. The recent development of an active electrode compensation (AEC) method has overcome some of these prior limitations, permitting artifact-free dynamic clamp experimentation with a single electrode. Here we describe an AEC method for the free dynamic clamp software StdpC. The AEC component of StdpC is the first such system implemented for the use of non-expert users and comes with a set of semi-automated configuration and calibration procedures that facilitate its use. We briefly introduce the AEC method and its implementation in StdpC and then validate it with an electronic model cell and in two different biological preparations.},

  abstract = {Invertebrates have been deployed very successfully in experimental studies of the nervous system and neuromuscular junctions. Many important discoveries on axonal conduction, synaptic transmission, integrative neurobiology and behaviour have been made by investigations of these remarkable animals. Their advantages as model organisms for investigations of nervous systems include (a) the large diameter of neurons, glia and muscle cells of some invertebrates, thereby facilitating microelectrode recordings; (b) simple nervous systems with few neurons, enhancing the tractability of neuronal circuitry; and (c) well-defined behaviours, which lend themselves to physiological and genetic dissection. Genetic model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans have provided powerful genetic approaches to central questions concerning nervous system development, learning and memory and the cellular and molecular basis of behaviour. The process of attributing function to particular gene products has been greatly accelerated in recent years with access to entire genome sequences and the application of reverse genetic (e.g. RNA interference, RNAi) and other post-genome technologies (e.g. microarrays). Studies of many other invertebrates, notably the honeybee (Apis mellifera), a nudibranch mollusc (Aplysia californica), locusts, lobsters, crabs, annelids and jellyfish have all assisted in the development of major concepts in neuroscience. The future is equally bright with ease of access to genome-wide reverse genetic technologies, and the development of optical recordings using voltage and intracellular calcium sensors genetically targeted to selected individual and groups of neurons.},

  abstract = {Background: Transcranial laser stimulation is a novel method of noninvasive brain stimulation found safe and effective for improving prefrontal cortex neurocognitive functions in healthy young adults. This method is different from electric and magnetic stimulation because it causes the photonic oxidation of cytochrome-c-oxidase, the rate-limiting enzyme for oxygen consumption and the major intracellular acceptor of photons from near-infrared light. This photobiomodulation effect promotes mitochondrial respiration, cerebrovascular oxygenation and neurocognitive function. Pilot studies suggest that transcranial photobiomodulation may also induce beneficial effects in aging individuals. Objectives: Randomized, sham-controlled study to test photobiomodulation effects caused by laser stimulation on cytochrome-c-oxidase oxidation and hemoglobin oxygenation in the prefrontal cortex of 68 healthy younger and older adults, ages 18--85. Methods: Broadband near-infrared spectroscopy was used for the noninvasive quantification of bilateral cortical changes in oxidized cytochrome-c-oxidase and hemoglobin oxygenation before, during and after 1064-nm wavelength laser (IR-A laser, area: 13.6 cm2, power density: 250 mW/cm2) or sham stimulation of the right anterior prefrontal cortex (Brodmann Area 10). Results: As compared to sham control, there was a significant laser-induced increase in oxidized cytochrome-c-oxidase during laser stimulation, followed by a significant post-stimulation increase in oxygenated hemoglobin and a decrease in deoxygenated hemoglobin. Furthermore, there was a greater laser-induced effect on cytochrome-c-oxidase with increasing age, while laser-induced effects on cerebral hemodynamics decreased with increasing age. No adverse laser effects were found. Conclusion: The findings support the use of transcranial photobiomodulation for cerebral oxygenation and alleviation of age-related decline in mitochondrial respiration. They justify further research on its therapeutic potential in neurologic and psychiatric diseases.},

Since the muscles producing the movements were striated and required nerve impulses to be activated, this system might serve as a model for studying how complex motor patterns were produced.

We discuss how the biophysical properties of each neuron and synapse in the two circuits act cooperatively to generate two different patterns of sequential activity, how these patterns are altered by neuromodulators and perturbed by noise and sensory inputs. Finally, we show how simplified Hindmarsh--Rose models can be made into analog electronic neurons that mimic the lobster neurons and in addition be incorporated into artificial CPGs with robotic applications.},

We used both a modified Hindmarsh-Rose model to simulate the neurons behavior phenomenologically and a more realistic conductance-based model so that the modeling could be linked to the experimental observations. Both models were able to capture the dynamics of the neuron behavior better than previous models. We used the Hindmarsh-Rose model as the basis for building electronic neurons which could then be integrated into the biological circuitry. Such neurons were able to rescue patterns which had been disabled by removing key biological neurons from the circuit.},

However, the mechanism of infrared stimulation has been a mystery, hindering its path to the clinic. Here we show that infrared light excites cells through a novel, highly general electrostatic mechanism. Infrared pulses are absorbed by water, producing a rapid local increase in temperature. This heating reversibly alters the electrical capacitance of the plasma membrane, depolarizing the target cell. This mechanism is fully reversible and requires only the most basic properties of cell membranes. Our findings underscore the generality of pulsed infrared stimulation and its medical potential. {\copyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The pair of giant reciprocally coupled neurons VD1 and RPaD2 within the CNS of the freshwater pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis was used to analyse the effect of hydrogen peroxide on gap-junction connection. Electrical activity of VD1/RPaD2 was recorded with intracellular microelectrodes in order to analyse gap-junction signalling. Hydrogen peroxide application (1 9 10-4 M) results in a rapid, 1.3-fold, increase in VD1/RPaD2 spiking frequency within 30 s after application. This was accompanied by a slight reduction in action potential amplitude. In addition, H 2 O 2 induced a significant reduction in the steady-state bidirectional coupling ratio between the neurons. The maximal reduction in the coupling ratio, 1.8-1.9 fold, was measured 3 min after H 2 O 2 application. However, the network input resistance did not undergo a detectable change. The voltage-gated Ca 2? channel blocker, nifedi-pine (1 9 10-4 M), abolished the effect of H 2 O 2 on the coupling ratio and firing frequency. All the effects of H 2 O 2 were reversible, that is, washing the preparation with standard physiological saline restored the properties of the neuronal coupling to the pre-treatment value. These data are consistent with a dynamic modulation of the gap-junction properties by H 2 O 2 between these two neurons.},

Open systems have a reputation for being difficult to acquire, poorly documented, and hard to maintain. With the arrival of more powerful and compact integrated circuits, rapid prototyping services, and web-based tools for collaborative development, these stereotypes must be reconsidered. We discuss some of the reasons why multichannel extracellular electrophysiology could benefit from open-source approaches and describe examples of successful community-driven tool development within this field. In order to promote the adoption of open-source hardware and to reduce the need for redundant development efforts, we advocate a move toward standardized interfaces that connect each element of the data processing pipeline. This will give researchers the flexibility to modify their tools when necessary, while allowing them to continue to benefit from the high-quality products and expertise provided by commercial vendors.},

Although such events have been observed in many neuronal types, it is not well understood how active dendrites contribute to the tuning of neuronal output in vivo. Here we show that dendritic spikes increase the selectivity of neuronal responses to the orientation of a visual stimulus (orientation tuning). We performed direct patch-clamp recordings from the dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the primary visual cortex of lightly anaesthetized and awake mice, during sensory processing. Visual stimulation triggered regenerative local dendritic spikes that were distinct from back-propagating action potentials. These events were orientation tuned and were suppressed by either hyperpolarization of membrane potential or intracellular blockade of NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptors. Both of these manipulations also decreased the selectivity of subthreshold orientation tuning measured at the soma, thus linking dendritic regenerative events to somatic orientation tuning. Together, our results suggest that dendritic spikes that are triggered by visual input contribute to a fundamental cortical computation: enhancing orientation selectivity in the visual cortex. Thus, dendritic excitability is an essential component of behaviourally relevant computations in neurons.},

  abstract = {The Golgi cells have been recently shown to beat regularly in vitro (Forti et al., 2006. J. Physiol. 574, 711-729). Four main currents were shown to be involved, namely a persistent sodium current (I(Na-p)), an h current (I(h)), an SK-type calcium-dependent potassium current (I(K-AHP)), and a slow M-like potassium current (I(K-slow)). These ionic currents could take part, together with others, also to different aspects of neuronal excitability like responses to depolarizing and hyperpolarizing current injection. However, the ionic mechanisms and their interactions remained largely hypothetical. In this work, we have investigated the mechanisms of Golgi cell excitability by developing a computational model. The model predicts that pacemaking is sustained by subthreshold oscillations tightly coupled to spikes. I(Na-p) and I(K-slow) emerged as the critical determinants of oscillations. I(h) also played a role by setting the oscillatory mechanism into the appropriate membrane potential range. I(K-AHP), though taking part to the oscillation, appeared primarily involved in regulating the ISI following spikes. The combination with other currents, in particular a resurgent sodium current (I(Na-r)) and an A-current (I(K-A)), allowed a precise regulation of response frequency and delay. These results provide a coherent reconstruction of the ionic mechanisms determining Golgi cell intrinsic electroresponsiveness and suggests important implications for cerebellar signal processing, which will be fully developed in a companion paper (Solinas et al., 2008. Front. Neurosci. 2:4).},

However, important genetic information on the formation and plasticity of one type, the electrical (gap junction-mediated) synapse, is understudied in many invertebrates. In the present study, we set forth to identify and characterize the gap junction-encoding gene innexin in the central nervous system (CNS) of the mollusk pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. With PCR, 3 and 5 RACE, and BLAST searches, we identified eight innexin genes in the L. stagnalis genome, named Lst Inx1-Lst Inx8. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the L. stagnalis innexin genes originated from a single copy in the common ancestor of molluskan species by multiple gene duplication events and have been maintained in L. stagnalis since they were generated. The paralogous innexin genes demonstrate distinct expression patterns among tissues. In addition, one paralog, Lst Inx1, exhibits heterogeneity in cells and ganglia, suggesting the occurrence of functional diversification after gene duplication. These results introduce possibilities to study an intriguing potential relationship between innexin paralog expression and cell-specific functional outputs such as heterogenic ability to form channels and exhibit synapse plasticity. The L. stagnalis CNS contains large neurons and functionally defined networks for behaviors; with the introduction of L. stagnalis in the gap junction gene field, we are providing novel opportunities to combine genetic research with direct investigations of functional outcomes at the cellular, synaptic, and behavioral levels.},

  abstract = {We used a behavioral learning paradigm followed by electrophysiological analysis to find sites in the Lymnaea feeding network in which electrical changes could be recorded after appetitive conditioning. Specifically, we analyzed conditioning-induced changes in cellular responses in the mechanosensory conditioned stimulus (CS) pathway, in the central pattern generator (CPG) network, and in feeding motoneurons. During training, experimental animals received 15 pairings of lip touch (the CS) with sucrose (the unconditioned stimulus, US). Control animals received 15 random CS and US presentations. Electrophysiological tests on semi-intact preparations made from conditioned animals demonstrated a network correlate of the overall feeding conditioned response, a touch-evoked CPG-driven fictive feeding rhythm. At the motoneuronal level, we found significant conditioning-induced increases in the amplitude of an early touch-evoked EPSP and spike activity, recorded from the B3 feeding motoneuron. Increases in EPSP amplitude and motoneuronal spike activity could occur independently of conditioned fictive feeding. These changes in response recorded at the level of CPG interneurons, and motoneurons were preceded by changes recorded in the CS pathway. This was demonstrated by recording a conditioning-induced increase in the number of touch-evoked spikes in the cerebrobuccal connective, which forms part of the CS pathway. The finding that electrophysiological changes after conditioning can be recorded at multiple sites in this simple system provided an important intermediate level of analysis between whole animal behavior and cellular studies on the synaptic sites of plasticity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rhythmic motor behaviors can be generated continuously (e.g., breathing) or episodically (e.g., locomotion, swallowing), when short or long bouts of rhythmic activity are interspersed with periods of quiescence. Although the mechanisms of rhythm generation are known in detail in many systems, there is very little understanding of how the episodic nature of rhythmic behavior is produced at the neuronal level. RESULTS: Using a well-established episodic rhythm-generating neural circuit controlling molluscan feeding, we demonstrate that quiescence between bouts of activity arises from active, maintained inhibition of an otherwise rhythmically active network. We show that the source of the suppressive drive is within the circuit itself; a single central pattern generator (CPG) interneuron type that fires tonically to inhibit feeding during quiescence. Suppression of the tonic activity of this neuron by food is sufficient to change the network from an inactive to a rhythmically active state, with the cell switching function to fire phasically as part of the food-evoked rhythmogenesis. Furthermore, the absolute level of intrinsic suppressive control is modulated extrinsically by the animal's behavioral state (e.g., hunger/satiety), increasing the probability of episodes of feeding when the animal is hungry. CONCLUSIONS: By utilizing the same intrinsic member of a CPG network in both rhythm-generation and suppression, this system has developed a simple and efficient mechanism for generating a variable level of response to suit the animal's changing behavioral demands.},

The neuronal network responsible for the three-phase feeding motor program (fictive feeding) has been characterized extensively and divided into populations of central pattern generator (CPG) interneurons, modulatory interneurons, and motoneurons. A previous model of the feeding system considered that the motoneurons were passive followers of CPG interneuronal activity. Here we present new, detailed physiological evidence that motoneurons that innervate the musculature of the feeding apparatus have significant electrotonic motoneuron{$\rightarrow$}interneuron connections, mainly confined to cells active in the same phase of the feeding cycle (protraction, rasp, or swallow). This suggested that the motoneurons participate in rhythm generation. This was assessed by manipulating firing activity in the motoneurons during maintained fictive feeding rhythms. Experiments showed that motoneurons contribute to the maintenance and phase setting of the feeding rhythm and provide an efficient system for phase-locking muscle activity with central neural activity. These data indicate that the distinction between motoneurons and interneurons in a complex CNS network like that involved in snail feeding is no longer justified and that both cell types are important in motor pattern generation. This is a distributed type of organization likely to be a general characteristic of CNS circuitries that produce rhythmic motor behavior.},

Thirty right-handed male subjects (18 to 40 years) were assigned to either an 'athlete' or a 'non-athlete' group, both containing 15 volunteers.

Choosing a research topic, deciding what papers to write and where to publish them, sticking with a familiar area or going into something new---the payoff may be tenure or a job at a highly ranked university or a prestigious award or a bump in salary. The risk may be not getting any of that.At a time when science is seen as an engine of economic growth, Paula Stephan brings a keen understanding of the ongoing cost-benefit calculations made by individuals and institutions as they compete for resources and reputation. She shows how universities offload risks by increasing the percentage of non-tenure-track faculty, requiring tenured faculty to pay salaries from outside grants, and staffing labs with foreign workers on temporary visas. With funding tight, investigators pursue safe projects rather than less fundable ones with uncertain but potentially path-breaking outcomes. Career prospects in science are increasingly dismal for the young because of ever-lengthening apprenticeships, scarcity of permanent academic positions, and the difficulty of getting funded.Vivid, thorough, and bold, How Economics Shapes Science highlights the growing gap between the haves and have-nots---especially the vast imbalance between the biomedical sciences and physics/engineering---and offers a persuasive vision of a more productive, more creative research system that would lead and benefit the world.},

  abstract = {Central pattern generators (CPGs) are generally defined as networks of neurons capable of enabling the production of central commands, specifically controlling stereotyped, rhythmic motor behaviors. Several CPGs localized in brainstem and spinal cord areas have been shown to underlie the expression of complex behaviors such as deglutition, mastication, respiration, defecation, micturition, ejaculation, and locomotion. Their pivotal roles have clearly been demonstrated although their organization and cellular properties remain incompletely characterized. In recent years, insightful findings about CPGs have been made mainly because (1) several complementary animal models were developed; (2) these models enabled a wide variety of techniques to be used and, hence, a plethora of characteristics to be discovered; and (3) organizations, functions, and cell properties across all models and species studied thus far were generally found to be well-preserved phylogenetically. This article aims at providing an overview for non-experts of the most important findings made on CPGs in in vivo animal models, in vitro preparations from invertebrate and vertebrate species as well as in primates. Data about CPG functions, adaptation, organization, and cellular properties will be summarized with a special attention paid to the network for locomotion given its advanced level of characterization compared with some of the other CPGs. Similarities and differences between these networks will also be highlighted.},

Stytra logs all recorded quantities, metadata, and code version in standardized formats to allow full provenance tracking, from data acquisition through analysis to publication. The package is modular and expandable for different experimental protocols and setups. Current releases can be found at https://github.com/portugueslab/stytra. We also provide complete documentation with examples for extending the package to new stimuli and hardware, as well as a schema and parts list for behavioral setups. We showcase Stytra by reproducing previously published behavioral protocols in both head-restrained and freely-swimming larvae. We also demonstrate the use of the software in the context of a calcium imaging experiment, where it interfaces with other acquisition devices. Our aims are to enable more laboratories to easily implement behavioral experiments, as well as to provide a platform for sharing stimulus protocols that permits easy reproduction of experiments and straightforward validation. Finally, we demonstrate how Stytra can serve as a platform to design behavioral experiments involving tracking or visual stimulation with other animals and provide an example integration with the DeepLabCut neural network-based tracking method.},

  abstract = {Understanding central pattern generator (CPG) circuits requires a detailed knowledge of the intrinsic cellular properties of the constituent neurons. These properties are poorly understood in most CPGs because of the complexity resulting from interactions with other neurons of the circuit. This is also the case in the feeding network of the snail, Lymnaea, one of the best-characterized CPG networks. We addressed this problem by isolating the interneurons comprising the feeding CPG in cell culture, which enabled us to study their basic intrinsic electrical and pharmacological cellular properties without interference from other network components. These results were then related to the activity patterns of the neurons in the intact feeding network. The most striking finding was the intrinsic generation of plateau potentials by medial N1 (N1M) interneurons. This property is probably critical for rhythm generation in the whole feeding circuit because the N1M interneurons are known to play a pivotal role in the initiation of feeding cycles in response to food. Plateau potential generation in another cell type, the ventral N2 (N2v), appeared to be conditional on the presence of acetylcholine. Examination of the other isolated feeding CPG interneurons [lateral N1 (N1L), dorsal N2 (N2d), phasic N3 (N3p)] and the modulatory slow oscillator (SO) revealed no significant intrinsic properties in relation to pattern generation. Instead, their firing patterns in the circuit appear to be determined largely by cholinergic and glutamatergic synaptic inputs from other CPG interneurons, which were mimicked in culture by application of these transmitters. This is an example of a CPG system where the initiation of each cycle appears to be determined by the intrinsic properties of a key interneuron, N1M, but most other features of the rhythm are probably determined by network interactions.},

Here we present the first study that investigates the modulatory actions of the CGCs and their released transmitter 5-HT on the CPG at the cellular level. In the snail, Lymnaea, motoneurons such as the B4, B8, and B4CL cells are part of the feeding CPG and receive serotonergic synaptic inputs from CGCs. These motoneurons were used to investigate the effect of serotonergic modulation on endogenous cellular properties of CPG neurons. Cells were isolated from the intact nervous system, and their properties were examined by pharmacological methods in cell culture. Motoneurons were also grown in coculture with CGCs to compare 5-HT effects with CGC stimulation. Three distinct modulatory effects of exogenously applied 5-HT/CGC activity were seen: all three motoneuron types were depolarized by 5-HT for prolonged periods leading to firing. Conditional bursting accompanied this depolarization in the B4/B8 cells, but not in B4CL cells. The frequency of the bursting was increased with increased CGC tonic firing. An increase in the size of postinhibitory rebound (PIR) occurred with 5-HT application in all three cell types, because of an increase in a CsCl-sensitive, hyperpolarization-activated inward current. Similar modulatory effects on membrane potential, endogenous bursting, and PIR properties could be observed in the intact nervous system and were necessary for motoneuron activation during feeding. Part of the systems gating and frequency control functions of the CGCs appear to be caused by these modulatory effects on feeding motoneurons.},

We previously developed an algorithm that automates ``blind'' patching in vivo, but full automation of visually guided, targeted in vivo patching has not been demonstrated, with currently available approaches requiring human intervention to compensate for cell movement as a patch pipette approaches a targeted neuron. Here we present a closed-loop real-time imaging strategy that automatically compensates for cell movement by tracking cell position and adjusting pipette motion while approaching a target. We demonstrate our system's ability to adaptively patch, under continuous two-photon imaging and real-time analysis, fluorophore-expressing neurons of multiple types in the living mouse cortex, without human intervention, with yields comparable to skilled human experimenters. Our ``imagepatching'' robot is easy to implement and will help enable scalable characterization of identified cell types in intact neural circuits.},

In isolated brain preparations a third identified interneuron, right pedal dorsal 1 (R.Pe.D.1) initiated the respiratory cycle by the excitation of Ip.3.I. Whereas Ip.3.I in turn excited R.Pe.D.1, the connections between R.Pe.D.1 and V.D.4 were mutually inhibitory. Both Ip.3.I and V.D.4 were active during spontaneously occurring respiratory behavior as recorded from semi-intact preparations, and selective hyperpolarization of V.D.4 during such spontaneous activity disrupted the respiratory behavior. Regarding peripheral feedback, the mechanical stimulation of the pneumostome during its opening movements not only caused closure but also inhibited Ip.3.I in the middle of its discharge. Ip.3.I and V.D.4 were also found to be multifunctional, inhibiting both locomotor and whole body withdrawal neural networks.

  abstract = {Over half of solar energy consists of near-infrared and a wide range of preventative mechanisms have been evolutionarily maintained in organisms to protect against effects of near-infrared. However, the biological effects of near-infrared have not been investigated in detail. Despite the essential requirement of a water-filter to imitate solar near-infrared filtered by atmospheric water, previous studies used near-infrared resources without a water-filter or a cooling system. With these methods, near-infrared energy is primarily absorbed in the superficial tissues, thus these approaches are unable to sufficiently evaluate the biological effects of solar near-infrared that reaches human tissue. We have elucidated that near-infrared (1100-1800nm together with a water-filter that excludes wavelengths 1400-1500nm) non-thermally affects the skin into the deeper tissues. The biological effects of near-infrared have both beneficial applications and deleterious effects. Near-infrared induces collagen and elastin stimulation, which achieves skin rejuvination and skin tightening, and induces long-lasting vasodilation that may prevent vasospasm and be beneficial for ischemic disorders. Near- infrared also relaxes and weakens dystonic and hypertrophic muscles to reduce wrinkles and myalgia. Near-infrared is an essential tool in cancer detection and imaging, and induces drastic non-thermal DNA damage of mitotic cels, which may be beneficial for treating cancer. Activation of stem cells by near-infrared may be useful in regenerative medicine. However, continuous near-infrared exposure induces photoaging and potentially photocarcinogenesis. Humans have protective mechanisms against near-infrared on multiple levels, including perspiration, blisters, vasodilation, hair, skin, adipose tissue, and cotton or wool clothing. Further protection should be considered, as biological effects of near-infrared are significant, and standard sunscreens and glasses cannot successfully block near-infrared. This paper reviews the effects of near-infrared and introduces the new findings of near-infrared from a biological point of view.},

  abstract = {We developed Carignan, a real-time calcium imaging software that can automatically detect activity patterns of neurons. Carignan can activate an external device when synchronized neural activity is detected in calcium imaging obtained by a one-photon (1p) miniscope. Combined with optogenetics, our software enables closed-loop experiments for investigating functions of specific types of neurons in the brain. In addition to making existing pattern detection algorithms run in real-time seamlessly, we developed a new classification module that distinguishes neurons from false-positives using deep learning. We used a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to incorporate both spatial and temporal features in activity patterns. Our method performed better than existing neuron detection methods for false-positive neuron detection in terms of the F1 score. Using Carignan, experimenters can activate or suppress a group of neurons when specific neural activity is observed. Because the system uses a 1p miniscope, it can be used on the brain of a freely-moving animal, making it applicable to a wide range of experimental paradigms.}

To clarify whether INS in the cochlea requires functioning hair cells and to explore the potential relevance to cochlear implants, experiments using INS were performed in the cochleae of both normal hearing and profoundly deaf guinea pigs. A response to laser stimulation was readily evoked in normal hearing cochlea. However, no response was evoked in any profoundly deaf cochleae, for either acute or chronic deafening, contrary to previous work where a response was observed after acute deafening with ototoxic drugs. A neural response to electrical stimulation was readily evoked in all cochleae after deafening. The absence of a response from optical stimuli in profoundly deaf cochleae suggests that the response from INS in the cochlea is hair cell mediated.},

In this chapter we review some of the most popular models of neurons and neural networks that help us understand how living systems perform information processing. Beyond the fundamental goal of understanding the function of the nervous system, the lessons learned from these models can also be used to build bio-inspired paradigms of artificial intelligence and robotics.},

  abstract = {The interaction between synaptic and intrinsic dynamics can efficiently shape neuronal input-output relationships in response to temporally structured spike trains. We use a neuron model with subthreshold oscillations receiving inputs through a synapse with short-term depression and facilitation to show that the combination of intrinsic subthreshold and synaptic dynamics leads to channel-specific nontrivial responses and recognition of specific temporal structures. We employ the Generalized Integrate-and-Fire (GIF) model, which can be subjected to analytical characterization. We map the temporal structure of spike input trains to the type of spike response, and show how the emergence of nontrivial input-output preferences is modulated by intrinsic and synaptic parameters in a synergistic manner. We demonstrate that these temporal input discrimination properties are robust to noise and to variations in synaptic strength, suggesting that they likely contribute to neuronal computation in biological circuits. Furthermore, we also illustrate the presence of these input-output relationships in conductance-based models. Author summary Neuronal subthreshold oscillations underlie key aspects of information processing in single neuron and network dynamics. Dynamic synapses provide a channel-specific temporal modulation of input information. We combine a neuron model that displays subthreshold oscillations and a dynamic synapse to analytically assess their interplay in processing trains of spike-mediated synaptic currents. Our results show that the co-action of intrinsic and synaptic dynamics builds nontrivial input-output relationships, which are resistant to noise and to changes in synaptic strength. The discrimination of a precise temporal structure of the input signal is shaped as a function of the joint interaction of intrinsic oscillations and synaptic dynamics. This interaction can result in channel-specific recognition of precise temporal patterns, hence greatly expanding the flexibility and complexity in information processing achievable by individual neurons with respect to temporal discrimination mechanisms based on intrinsic neuronal dynamics alone.},

Assuming a Hebbian prescription for the maximal synaptic conductances that balances ex-citatory and inhibitory synaptic connections, and short-term synaptic plasticity processes affecting such conductances, the system exhibits dynamical well-defined phases. This includes a memory phase, in which population of neurons remain synchronized, an oscillatory phase characterized by jumps between different synchronized populations of neurons, and an asynchronous noisy phase. Increasing noise in the medium when a weak input stimulates each neuron, intriguing phenomena occurs near all the transition points between phases resulting in the emergence of stochastic multi-resonance. This is shown to be quite robust, as it occurs for different levels of synaptic plasticity, type and number of stored patterns , and network topologies. Such robustness suggests that the behaviour shown by the models here should also be observable in actual systems, as a recent psy-chophysical experiment seems also indicate. Would this be the case, monitoring multi-resonance may help neuroscientists to identify and investigate the existence of phase transitions in the brain, which have been recently associated to some of its high level functions.},

  abstract = {To better understand population phenomena in thalamocortical neuronal ensembles, we have constructed a preliminary network model with 3,560 multicompartment neurons (containing soma, branching dendrites, and a portion of axon). Types of neurons included superficial pyramids (with regular spiking [RS] and fast rhythmic bursting [FRB] firing behaviors); RS spiny stellates; fast spiking (FS) interneurons, with basket-type and axoaxonic types of connectivity, and located in superficial and deep cortical layers; low threshold spiking (LTS) interneurons, which contacted principal cell dendrites; deep pyramids, which could have RS or intrinsic bursting (IB) firing behaviors, and endowed either with nontufted apical dendrites or with long tufted apical dendrites: thalamocortical relay (TCR) cells; and nucleus reticularis (nRT) cells. To the extent possible, both electrophysiology and synaptic connectivity were based on published data, although many arbitrary choices were necessary. In addition to synaptic connectivity (by AMPA/kainate, NMDA, and GABAA receptors), we also included electrical coupling between dendrites of interneurons, nRT cells, and TCR cells, and-in various combinations-electrical coupling between the proximal axons of certain cortical principal neurons. Our network model replicates several observed population phenomena, including 1) persistent gamma oscillations; 2) thalamocortical sleep spindles; 3) series of synchronized population bursts, resembling electrographic seizures; 4) isolated double population bursts with superimposed very fast oscillations (\&gt;100 Hz, "VFO"); 5) spike-wave, polyspike-wave, and fast runs (about 10 Hz). We show that epileptiform bursts, including double and multiple bursts, containing VFO occur in rat auditory cortex in vitro, in the presence of kainate, when both GABAA and GABAB receptors are blocked. Electrical coupling between axons appears necessary (as reported previously) for persistent gamma and additionally plays a role in the detailed shaping of epileptogenic events. The degree of recurrent synaptic excitation between spiny stellate cells, and their tendency to fire throughout multiple bursts, also appears critical in shaping epileptogenic events.

Complex temporal coordination, e.g., during movements at different frequencies with a noninteger ratio (polyrhythms), requires training. Here, we investigate the organization of the neural control systems for in-phase, antiphase, and polyrhythmic coordination using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Brisk rhythmic tapping with the index fingers was used as a model behavior. We demonstrate different patterns of brain activity during in-phase and antiphase coordination. In-phase coordination was characterized by activation of the right anterior cerebellum and cingulate motor area (CMA). Antiphase coordination was accompanied by extensive fronto-parieto-temporal activations, including the supplementary motor area (SMA), the preSMA, and the bilateral inferior parietal gyri, premotor cortex, and superior temporal gyri. When contrasting polyrhythmic tapping with in-phase tapping, activity was seen in the same set of brain regions, and in the posterior cerebellum and the CMA. Antiphase and polyrhythmic coordination may thus to a large extent use common neural control circuitry. In a separate experiment, we analyzed the neural control of the rhythmic structure and the serial order of finger movements during polyrhythmic tapping. Polyrhythmic tapping was compared with an isochronous coordination pattern that retained the same serial order of finger movements as the polyrhythm. This experiment showed that the preSMA and the bilateral superior temporal gyri may be crucial for the rhythmic control of polyrhythmic tapping, while the cerebellum, the CMA, and the premotor cortices presumably are more involved in the ordinal control of the sequence of finger movements.},

Proper use of TMS in the fundamental and clinical neuroscience research requires a deep understanding of its operational principles, risks, potential and limitations. In this article we present the principles through which TMS is thought to operate. Readers will be provided with the bases to be able to understand and critically discuss TMS studies and design hypothesis driven TMS applications for basic and clinical neuroscience.

These models identify an additional slow dynamical process - calcium exchange and storage in the endoplasmic reticulum - as a biologically plausible source for the observed chaos in the oscillations of these cells. In this paper we test these ideas further by exploring the dynamical behavior when two model neurons are coupled by electrical or gap junction connections. We compare in detail the model results to the laboratory measurements of electrically-coupled neurons that we reported earlier. The experiments on the biological neurons varied the strength of the effective coupling by applying a parallel, artificial synapse, which changed both the magnitude and polarity of the conductance between the neurons. We observed a sequence of bifurcations that took the neurons from strongly synchronized in-phase behavior, through uncorrelated chaotic oscillations to strongly synchronized - and now regular - out-of-phase behavior. The model calculations reproduce these observations quantitatively, indicating that slow subcellular processes could account for the mechanisms involved in the synchronization and regularization of the otherwise individual chaotic activities.}

Traditional studies on the interaction of cognitive functions in healthy and disordered brains have used the analyses of the connectivity of several specialized brain networks---the functional connectome. However, emerging evidence suggests that both brain networks and functional spontaneous brain-wide network communication are intrinsically dynamic. In the light of studies investigating the cooperation between different cognitive functions, we consider here the dynamics of hierarchical networks in cognitive space. We show, using an example of behavioural decision-making based on sequential episodic memory, how the description of metastable pattern dynamics underlying basic cognitive processes helps to understand and predict complex processes like sequential episodic memory recall and competition among decision strategies. The mathematical images of the discussed phenomena in the phase space of the corresponding cognitive model are hierarchical heteroclinic networks. One of the most important features of such networks is the robustness of their dynamics. Different kinds of instabilities of these dynamics can be related to `dynamical signatures' of creativity and different psychiatric disorders. The suggested approach can also be useful for the understanding of the dynamical processes that are the basis of consciousness.},

Novel experimental techniques in neuroscience research allow observing and interacting with neural activity at a variety of spatial and temporal scales and provide improved coverage and resolution. However, classical stimulus-response paradigms with offline analysis remain prevalent in most experimental studies. In this chapter, we discuss online event detection requirements in novel experimental protocols using closed-loop technologies that can improve neuroscience experiments in a complementary way to simply enhancing coverage and resolution. Closed-loop methods can help overcome the fundamentally partial observation nature of experimental neuroscience, help reveal neural computation mechanisms in transient neural dynamics, and help bridge between disparate levels of description.

Novel experimental techniques in neuroscience research allow observing and interacting with neural activity at a variety of spatial and temporal scales and provide improved coverage and resolution. However, classical stimulus-response paradigms with offline analysis remain prevalent in most experimental studies. In this chapter, we discuss online event detection requirements in novel experimental protocols using closed-loop technologies that can improve neuroscience experiments in a complementary way to simply enhancing coverage and resolution. Closed-loop methods can help overcome the fundamentally partial observation nature of experimental neuroscience, help reveal neural computation mechanisms in transient neural dynamics, and help bridge between disparate levels of description. We review some examples of effective closed-loop interactions ranging from in vitro experiments to brain-computer interfaces and behavioral studies, and then discuss a common framework for effective online event detection in closed-loop experimental protocols.},

  abstract = {An essential question raised after the observation of highly variable bursting activity in individual neurons of Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) is how an assembly of such cells can cooperatively act to produce regular signals to motor systems. It is well known that some neurons in the lobster stomatogastric ganglion have a highly irregular spiking-bursting behavior when they are synaptically isolated from any connection in the CPG. Experimental recordings show that periodic stimuli on a single neuron can regulate its firing activity. Other evidence demonstrates that specific chemical and/or electrical synapses among neurons also induce the regularization of the rhythms. In this paper we present a modeling study in which a slow subcellular dynamics, the exchange of calcium between an intracellular store and the cytoplasm, is responsible for the origin and control of the irregular spiking-bursting activity. We show this in simulations of single cells under periodic driving and in minimal networks where the cooperative activity can induce regularization. While often neglected in the description of realistic neuron models, subcellular processes with slow dynamics may play an important role in information processing and short-term memory of spiking-bursting neurons. {\copyright}2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Also, we found that the injection type of serotonergic agents (systemic or local), the doses of these drugs (dose-dependent effects), and up- or down-regulation of serotonergic receptors during training with various memory tasks are important issues that can be involved in the effects of serotonergic signaling on sleep--wake cycle, memory function, and sleep deprivation-induced memory impairments.

  abstract = {The Cerebral Giant Cells (CGCs) are a pair of identifi ed modulatory interneurons in the Central Nervous System of the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis with an important role in the expression of both unconditioned and conditioned feeding behavior. Following single-trial food-reward classical conditioning, the membrane potential of the CGCs becomes persistently depolarized. This depolarization contributes to the conditioned response by facilitating sensory cell to command neuron synapses, which results in the activation of the feeding network by the conditioned stimulus. Despite the depolarization of the membrane potential, which enables the CGGs to play a key role in learning-induced network plasticity, there is no persistent change in the tonic fi ring rate or shape of the action potentials, allowing these neurons to retain their normal network function in feeding. In order to understand the ionic mechanisms of this novel combination of plasticity and stability of intrinsic electrical properties, we fi rst constructed and validated a Hodgkin-Huxley-type model of the CGCs. We then used this model to elucidate how learninginduced changes in a somal persistent sodium and a delayed rectifi er potassium current lead to a persistent depolarization of the CGCs whilst maintaining their fi ring rate. Including in the model an additional increase in the conductance of a high-voltage-activated calcium current allowed the spike amplitude and spike duration also to be maintained after conditioning. We conclude therefore that a balanced increase in three identifi ed conductances is suffi cient to explain the electrophysiological changes found in the CGCs after classical conditioning. {\copyright} 2010 Vavoulis.},

  abstract = {Central pattern generators (CPGs) are networks underlying rhythmic motor behaviours and they are dynamically regulated by neuronal elements that are extrinsic or intrinsic to the rhythmogenic circuit. In the feeding system of the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, the extrinsic slow oscillator (SO) interneuron controls the frequency of the feeding rhythm and the N3t (tonic) has a dual role; it is an intrinsic CPG interneuron, but it also suppresses CPG activity in the absence of food, acting as a decision-making element in the feeding circuit. The firing patterns of the SO and N3t neurons and their synaptic connections with the rest of the CPG are known, but how these regulate network function is not well understood. This was investigated by building a computer model of the feeding network based on a minimum number of cells (N1M, N2v and N3t) required to generate the three-phase motor rhythm together with the SO that was used to activate the system. The intrinsic properties of individual neurons were represented using two-compartment models containing currents of the Hodgkin-Huxley type. Manipulations of neuronal activity in the N3t and SO neurons in the model produced similar quantitative effects to food and electrical stimulation in the biological network indicating that the model is a useful tool for studying the dynamic properties of the feeding circuit. The model also predicted novel effects of electrical stimulation of two CPG interneurons (N1M and N2v). When tested experimentally, similar effects were found in the biological system providing further validation of our model. {\copyright} The Authors (2007).},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}We describe the role of the octopamine-containing OC interneurons in the buccal feeding system of Lymnaea stagnalis. OC neurons are swallowing phase interneurons receiving inhibitory inputs in the N1 and N2 phases, and excitatory inputs in the N3 phase of fictive feeding. Although the OC neurons do not always fire during feeding, the feeding rate is significantly ( P \&lt; 0.001) higher when both SO and OC fire in each cycle than when only the SO fires. In 28\% of silent preparations, a single stimulation of an OC interneuron evokes the feeding pattern. Repetitive stimulation of the OC interneuron increases the proportion of responsive preparations to 41\%. The OC interneuron not only changes both the feeding rate and reconfigures the pattern. Depolarization of the OC interneurons increases the feeding rate and removes the B3 motor neuron from the firing sequence. Hyperpolarization slows it down (increasing the duration of N1 and N3 phases) and recruits the B3 motor neuron. OC interneurons form synaptic connections onto buccal motor neurons and interneurons but not onto the cerebral (cerebral giant cell) modulatory neurons. OC interneurons are electrically coupled to all N3 phase (B4, B4Cl, B8) feeding motor neurons. They form symmetrical connections with the N3p interneurons having dual electrical (excitatory) and chemical (inhibitory) components. OC interneurons evoke biphasic synaptic inputs on the protraction phase interneurons (SO, N1L, N1M), with a short inhibition followed by a longer lasting depolarization. N2d interneurons are hyperpolarized, while N2v interneurons are slowly depolarized and often fire a burst after OC stimulation. Most motor neurons also receive synaptic responses from the OC interneurons. Although OC and N3p interneurons are both swallowing phase interneurons, their synaptic contacts onto follower neurons are usually different (e.g., the B3 motor neurons are inhibited by OC, but excited by N3p interneurons). Repetitive stimulation of OC interneuron facilitates the excitatory component of the biphasic responses evoked on the SO, N1L, and N1M interneurons, but neither the N2 nor the N3 phase interneurons display a similar longer-lasting excitatory effect. OC interneurons are inhibited by all the buccal feeding interneurons, but excited by the serotonergic modulatory CGC neurons. We conclude that OC interneurons are a new kind of swallowing phase interneurons. Their connections with the buccal feeding interneurons can account for their modulatory effects on the feeding rhythm. As they contain octopamine, this is the first example in Lymnaea that monoaminergic modulation and reconfiguration are provided by an intrinsic member of the buccal feeding network.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In semi-intact (lip-mouth-CNS) preparations, this central pattern generator is activated by chemosensory inputs. We now test if sucrose application to the lips activates the OC neurons independently of the rest of the feeding central pattern generator, or if the OC interneuron is activated by inputs from the feeding network. In 66\% of experiments, sucrose stimulated feeding rhythms and OC interneurons received regular synaptic inputs. Only rarely (14\%) did the OC interneuron fire action potentials, proving that firing of OC interneurons is not necessary for the sucrose-induced feeding. Prestimulation of OC neurons increased the intensity and duration of the feeding rhythm evoked by subsequent sucrose presentations. One micromolar octopamine in the CNS bath mimicked the effect of OC interneuron stimulation, enhancing the feeding response when sucrose is applied to the lips. We conclude that the modulatory OC neurons are not independently excited by chemosensory inputs to the lips, but rather from the buccal central pattern generator network. However, when OC neurons fire, they release modulatory octopamine, which provides a positive feedback to the network to enhance the sucrose-activated central pattern generator rhythm. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

For high species, the control and coordination of the network dynamics is a function of the higher levels of the central nervous system, in particular the cerebellum. However, in many cases, especially for invertebrates, such coordination is the result of direct synaptic connections between small circuits. We show here that even the chaotic sequential activity of small model networks can be coordinated by electrotonic synapses connecting one or several pairs of neurons that belong to two different networks. As an example, we analyzed the coordination and synchronization of the sequential activity of two statocyst model networks of the marine mollusk Clione. The statocysts are gravity sensory organs that play a key role in postural control of the animal and the generation of a complex hunting motor program. Each statocyst network was modeled by a small ensemble of neurons with Lotka-Volterra type dynamics and nonsymmetric inhibitory interactions. We studied how two such networks were synchronized by electrical coupling in the presence of an external signal which lead to winnerless competition among the neurons. We found that as a function of the number and the strength of connections between the two networks, it is possible to coordinate and synchronize the sequences that each network generates with its own chaotic dynamics. In spite of the chaoticity, the coordination of the signals is established through an activation sequence lock for those neurons that are active at a particular instant of time.},

We show with immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and electrophysiology that Connexin-36 is necessary for functional gap junctions (GJs) between GoC dendrites. In the absence of coincident synaptic input, GoCs synchronize their firing. In contrast, sparse, coincident mossy fiber input triggered a mixture of excitation and inhibition of GoC firing and spike desynchronization. Inhibition is caused by propagation of the spike afterhyperpolarization through GJs. This triggers network desynchronization because heterogeneous coupling to surrounding cells causes spike-phase dispersion. Detailed network models predict that desynchronization is robust, local, and dependent on synaptic input properties. Our results show that GJ coupling can be inhibitory and either promote network synchronization or trigger rapid network desynchronization depending on the synaptic input. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

It has long been recognized that specific groups of ion channels are functionally coupled in mediating ionic fluxes that impact membrane potential, and that these changes in membrane potential impact ion channel gating. Recent studies have identified distinct sets of ion channels that can also physically and functionally associate to regulate the function of either ion channel partner beyond that afforded by changes in membrane potential alone. Here, we review canonical examples of such ion channel partnerships, in which a Ca2+ channel is partnered with a Ca2+-activated K+ channel to provide a dedicated route for efficient coupling of Ca2+ influx to K+ channel activation. We also highlight examples of non-canonical ion channel partnerships between Ca2+ channels and voltage-gated K+ channels that are not intrinsically Ca2+ sensitive, but whose partnership nonetheless yields enhanced regulation of one or the other ion channel partner. We also discuss how these ion channel partnerships can be shaped by the subcellular compartments in which they are found and provide perspectives on how recent advances in techniques to identify proteins in close proximity to one another in native cells may lead to an expanded knowledge of other ion channel partnerships.},

An identified interneuron in the abdominal ganglion of Aplysia mediates both direct excitation and inhibition to an identified follower cell. At low firing rates the interneuron produces excitatory postsynaptic potentials; however at higher firing rates these gradually diminish in size and eventually invert to inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. Electrophysiological and pharmacological evidence indicates that the connection between these cells is monosynaptic, and that a single transmitter, acetylcholine, mediates both actions. These opposite synaptic responses appear to result from the transmitter's acting on two types of postsynaptic receptors having different thresholds for activation and different susceptibilities for desensitization.},

  abstract = {{\copyright} 2017 SPIE. Short infrared laser pulses induce a variety of effects in cells and tissues, including neural stimulation and inhibition. However, the mechanism behind these physiological effects is poorly understood. It is known that the fast thermal gradient induced by the infrared light is necessary for these biological effects. Therefore, this study tests the hypothesis that the fast thermal gradient induced in a cell by infrared light exposure causes a change in the membrane fluidity. To test this hypothesis, we used the membrane fluidity dye, di-4-ANEPPDHQ, to investigate membrane fluidity changes following infrared light exposure. Di-4-ANEPPDHQ fluorescence was imaged on a wide-field fluorescence imaging system with dual channel emission detection. The dual channel imaging allowed imaging of emitted fluorescence at wavelengths longer and shorter than 647 nm for ratiometric assessment and computation of a membrane generalized polarization (GP) value. Results in CHO cells show increased membrane fluidity with infrared light pulse exposure and this increased fluidity scales with infrared irradiance. Full recovery of pre-infrared exposure membrane fluidity was observed. Altogether, these results demonstrate that infrared light induces a thermal gradient in cells that changes membrane fluidity.},

  abstract = {Fast neuronal oscillations (gamma, 20--80 Hz) have been observed in the neocortex and hippocampus during behavioral arousal. Using computer simulations, we investigated the hypothesis that such rhythmic activity can emerge in a random network of interconnected GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons. Specific conditions for the population synchronization, on properties of single cells and the circuit, were identified. These include the following: (1) that the amplitude of spike afterhyperpolarization be above the GABAA synaptic reversal potential; (2) that the ratio between the synaptic decay time constant and the oscillation period be sufficiently large; (3) that the effects of heterogeneities be modest because of a steep frequency--current relationship of fast-spiking neurons. Furthermore, using a population coherence measure, based on coincident firings of neural pairs, it is demonstrated that large-scale network synchronization requires a critical (minimal) average number of synaptic contacts per cell, which is not sensitive to the network size. By changing the GABAA synaptic maximal conductance, synaptic decay time constant, or the mean external excitatory drive to the network, the neuronal firing frequencies were gradually and monotonically varied. By contrast, the network synchronization was found to be high only within a frequency band coinciding with the gamma (20--80 Hz) range. We conclude that the GABAA synaptic transmission provides a suitable mechanism for synchronized gamma oscillations in a sparsely connected network of fast-spiking interneurons. In turn, the interneuronal network can presumably maintain subthreshold oscillations in principal cell populations and serve to synchronize discharges of spatially distributed neurons.},

  abstract = {{\copyright} 2018 The Authors. Transcranial infrared laser stimulation (TILS) has shown effectiveness in improving human cognition and was investigated using broadband near-infrared spectroscopy (bb-NIRS) in our previous study, but the effect of laser heating on the actual bb-NIRS measurements was not investigated. To address this potential confounding factor, 11 human participants were studied. First, we measured time-dependent temperature increases on forehead skin using clinical-grade thermometers following the TILS experimental protocol used in our previous study. Second, a subject-averaged, time-dependent temperature alteration curve was obtained, based on which a heat generator was controlled to induce the same temperature increase at the same forehead location that TILS was delivered on each participant. Third, the same bb-NIRS system was employed to monitor hemodynamic and metabolic changes of forehead tissue near the thermal stimulation site before, during, and after the heat stimulation. The results showed that cytochrome-c-oxidase of forehead tissue was not significantly modified by this heat stimulation. Significant differences in oxyhemoglobin, total hemoglobin, and differential hemoglobin concentrations were observed during the heat stimulation period versus the laser stimulation. The study demonstrated a transient hemodynamic effect of heat-based stimulation distinct to that of TILS. We concluded that the observed effects of TILS on cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism are not induced by heating the skin.},

  abstract = {1. The stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of decapod crustaceans has been characterized by its production of two motor patterns, the gastric mill rhythm and the pyloric rhythm. The period of the gastric rhythm is typically 5-10 s, whereas the period of the pyloric rhythm is approximately 1 s. 2. In the STG of the crab, Cancer borealis, we find routinely that many motor neurons are active in time with both the pyloric and gastric rhythms. We rigorously identified the motor neurons according to the muscles they innervate. Some neurons usually classified as members of the pyloric network can be active in time with the gastric rhythm. All of the gastric motor neurons except the dorsal gastric (DG) neuron can generate pyloric-timed firing patterns. 3. Two motor neurons innervate muscles found in several different regions of the stomach. The inferior cardiac (IC) neuron, usually considered part of the pyloric network, innervates cardiac sac, gastric mill, and pyloric muscles. The lateral posterior gastric (LPG) neurons innervate muscles of both the gastric mill and the pyloric chamber. 4. These data show that the gastric and pyloric networks in the crab are not separate groups of neurons that independently generate two different rhythmic behaviors. Rather, these neurons together provide a synaptically connected pool of neurons from which many different pattern-generating circuits can be assembled, under different physiological conditions.},

Optical stimulation elicits compound nerve and muscle potentials similar to responses obtained with conventional electrical neural stimulation in a rat sciatic nerve model. Stimulation and damage thresholds were determined as a function of wavelength using a tunable free electron laser source (=2 to 10 {\textmu}m) and a solid state holmium:YAG laser (=2.12 {\textmu}m). Threshold radiant exposure required for stimulation varies with wavelength from 0.312 J/cm2 (=3 {\textmu}m) to 1.22 J/cm2 (=2.1 {\textmu}m). Histological analysis indicates no discernable thermal damage with suprathreshold stimulation. The largest damage/stimulation threshold ratios ({$>$}6) were at wavelengths corresponding to valleys in the IR spectrum of soft tissue absorption (4 and 2.1 {\textmu}m). Furthermore, optical stimulation can be used to generate a spatially selective response in small fascicles of the sciatic nerve that has significant advantages (e.g., noncontact, spatial resolution, lack of stimulation artifact) over conventional electrical methods in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in neuroscience, neurology, and neurosurgery.},

Here we investigate the biophysical mechanism underlying this phenomenon by careful examination of possible photobiological effects after absorption-driven light-tissue interaction. The rat sciatic nerve preparation was stimulated in vivo with a Holmium:yttrium aluminum garnet laser (2.12 {$\mu$}m), free electron laser (2.1 {$\mu$}m), alexandrite laser (750 nm), and prototype solid-state laser nerve stimulator (1.87 {$\mu$}m). We systematically determined relative contributions from a list of plausible interaction types resulting in optical stimulation, including thermal, pressure, electric field, and photochemical effects. Collectively, the results support our hypothesis that direct neural activation with pulsed laser light is induced by a thermal transient. We then present data that characterize and quantify the spatial and temporal nature of this required temperature rise, including a measured surface temperature change required for stimulation of the peripheral nerve (6{$^\circ$}C-10{$^\circ$}C). This interaction is a photothermal effect from moderate, transient tissue heating, a temporally and spatially mediated temperature gradient at the axon level (3.8{$^\circ$}C-6.4{$^\circ$}C), resulting in direct or indirect activation of transmembrane ion channels causing action potential generation. {\copyright} 2007 by the Biophysical Society.},

As a result, invertebrates are being evaluated and recognized as models for many diseases and conditions. Their use has led to discoveries in almost every area of biology and medicine--from embryonic development to aging processes. Species range from terrestrial invertebrates such as nematodes and insects to freshwater and marine life including planarians, crustaceans, molluscs, and many others. The most often used models are the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the minuscule nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Topics in this article are categorized by biologic system, process, or disease with discussion of associated invertebrate models. Sections on bioactive products discovered from invertebrates follow the models section, and the article concludes with uses of invertebrates in teaching.

However, SNNs have developed separately from artificial neural networks (ANNs), limiting the impact of deep learning advances for SNNs. Here, we present an alternative perspective of the spiking neuron that incorporates its neural dynamics into a recurrent ANN unit called a spiking neural unit (SNU). SNUs may operate as SNNs, using a step function activation, or as ANNs, using continuous activations. We demonstrate the advantages of SNU dynamics through simulations on multiple tasks and obtain accuracies comparable to, or better than, those of ANNs. The SNU concept enables an efficient implementation with in-memory acceleration for both training and inference. We experimentally demonstrate its efficacy for a music-prediction task in an in-memory-based SNN accelerator prototype using 52,800 phase-change memory devices. Our results open up an avenue for broad adoption of biologically inspired neural dynamics in challenging applications and acceleration with neuromorphic hardware.},

In this context, this work aims at providing a new perspective on the definition of luminescence-based thermometric parameters using dimensionality reduction techniques that emerged in the last years. The application of linear (Principal Component Analysis) and non-linear (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) transformations to the calibration datasets obtained from rare-earth nanoparticles and semiconductor nanocrystals resulted in an improvement in thermal resolution compared to the more classical intensity-based and ratiometric approaches. This, in turn, enabled precise monitoring of temperature changes smaller than 0.1 {$^\circ$}C. The methods here presented allow choosing superior thermometric parameters compared to the more classical ones, pushing the performance of luminescent thermometers close to the experimentally achievable limits.},

The molecular timescale, normally too short to be seen in experiments, can be of a significant length for proteins. To probe it directly, we studied very rapidly folding mutants of the five-helix bundle protein {$\lambda$}6--85, whose activated state is significantly populated during folding. A time-dependent rate coefficient below 2 {\textmu}s signals the onset of the molecular timescale, and hence the ultimate speed limit for folding2. A simple model shows that the molecular timescale represents the natural pre-factor for transition state models of folding.},

Plenty of work remains ahead to provide medical practitioners with solid proof of the potential advantages of this imaging technique. To do so, one of the key objectives is to better the optical performance of dedicated contrast agents, thus improving the resolution and penetration depth achievable. This direction is followed here and the use of a novel AgInSe               2               nanoparticle-based contrast agent (nanocapsule) is reported for fluorescence imaging. The use of an Ag               2               Se seeds-mediated synthesis method allows stabilizing an uncommon orthorhombic crystal structure, which endows the material with emission in the second biological window (1000--1400~nm), where deeper penetration in tissues is achieved. The nanocapsules, obtained via phospholipid-assisted encapsulation of the AgInSe               2               nanoparticles, comply with the mandatory requisites for an imaging contrast agent---colloidal stability and negligible toxicity---and show superior brightness compared with widely used Ag               2               S nanoparticles. Imaging experiments point to the great potential of the novel AgInSe               2               -based nanocapsules for high-resolution, whole-body in vivo imaging.

  abstract = {A hybrid system in which an olivary neuron was interconnected to an analog simulator was used to study possible mechanisms by which the combined behavior of individual olivary neurons evokes synchronized membrane potential oscillations in a large population of neurons. The analog system was composed of four identical, interconnected oscillating units, each of which was capable of producing a damped sinusoidal oscillation in response to a trigger signal. When the units were coupled to each other, a single trigger pulse to one unit could evoke sustained oscillations. The integrity of the connections within the system was required to maintain these oscillations. In the hybrid system the analog system was reciprocally connected to an olivary neuron in a slice preparation. As in the analog system, the hybrid system could generate sustained oscillations following a trigger pulse to one of the units, as well as following a low threshold Ca spike in the neuron. Activation of the low threshold Ca conductance in the olivary neuron was necessary to achieve both gain and in-phase activity within the hybrid system, and thereby sustain the oscillations. The ability of the hybrid system to generate sustained oscillation is frequency dependent. Sustained oscillations were readily obtained at a "preferred frequency" of 5.2 Hz (n = 7) which was independent on the parameters used by the simulator, or on the membrane potential of the neurons. These results, which demonstrate the advantage of a new experimental approach developed to study rhythmogenesis in inferior olivary neurons, support the hypothesis that the inferior olivary nucleus, acting as an interconnected network of oscillating units, can generate an accurate subthreshold oscillation that serves as an internal time reference. ?? 1991.}

The mean CGC firing rates recorded in vivo varied between 1 and 20 spikes/min but never reached the average rates seen in the isolated CNS (60-120 spikes/min). Maximum rates of firing were seen during bouts of radula biting/rasping movements characteristic of the consummatory phase of feeding (15 {\textpm} 1.69 spikes/min, mean {\textpm} SE, range 7-20 spikes/min), with lower rates seen during locomotion (6.7 {\textpm} 0.75 spikes/min; range 5-9 spikes/min. The cells were rarely active when the animal was quiescent (1.45 {\textpm} 0.91 spikes/min; range 0-2 spikes/min). 4. In vivo recorded CGC firing was phase locked to the feeding movements of the animal, with spikes occurring just before the opening of the mouth, during the protraction phase of the feeding cycle. 5. Evoking firing rates on the CGCs in the isolated preparation similar to those seen in vivo during rasping movements (7-20 spikes/min) did not elicit a fictive feeding pattern in an inactive preparation. Neither did bath application of 10-9 M serotonin (5-HT; the transmitter of the CGCs). 6. To allow the modulatory role of the CGCs to be examined during patterned activity, the fictive feeding pattern was evoked in the isolated preparation by injecting depolarizing current into a modulatory neuron, the slow oscillator (SO). 7. The tonic firing activity of the CGCs was accurately maintained by current injection in the isolated preparation at rates equivalent to that occurring during feeding, locomotion, and quiescence in the intact snail. This was possible where the CGCs became silent after 1-2 h. Only when the CGCs activity was maintained at a rate ({\textasciitilde}15 spikes/min) similar to that occurring during rasping, was the SO able to drive a full, high-frequency fictive feeding pattern (15-20 cycles/min). At lower rates of CGC firing, the SO- driven rhythm was either of lower frequency or no rhythm occurred at all (CGCs silent). 8. In many isolated preparations (80\%) the CGCs remained active, and it was difficult to maintain specific levels of tonic activity by current injection. Here attempts to completely suppress CGC activity produced a lowering of fictive feeding rates but did not lead to the complete loss of the SO-driven pattern in the isolated preparation. Residual levels of CGC activity (axon spikes recorded) were still likely to be present. 9. Low concentrations of 5-HT (10-9-10-8 M) perfused over the buccal ganglia allowed the SO to drive a full, high-frequency fictive feeding rhythm in preparations where the CGCs were already silent or spike activity had been suppressed by hyperpolarizing current injection. 10. Perfusion of a variety of serotonergic antagonists across the buccal ganglia [7-methyltryptamine (7- MT) and cinanserin], when the CGCs were tonically active, slowed the rate of the SO-driven motor program to values comparable with mean frequencies seen in the CGC spike suppression experiments. 11. It is concluded that the CGCs and their transmitter 5-HT have a modulatory rather than a command function in the feeding system of Lymnaea. One type of modulation (gating function) requires a sufficient level of activity in the CGCs to 'enable' a second type of neuron (the SO) to drive a feeding rhythm. Above this gating threshold (7 spikes/min), within the 7-to 20-spikes/min firing range, the CGCs influence the frequency of the motor pattern, a second type of modulatory function.},

  abstract = {1. Photoinactivation of dye-filled neurons was used to examine the modulatory role of the paired cerebral giant cells (CGCs) in the Lymnaea feeding system. 2. Both CGCs were filled with fluorescent dyes. Lucifer yellow was used for "soma" kills and injected via intracellular microelectrodes. CGC axons were retrogradely filled with 5 (6)-carboxyfluorescein (5-CF), through the cut ends of the ventro- and lateral buccal nerves, for "axonal" kills. 3. Irradiation of the CGC soma with a blue laser light (0.5 MW/m2) led to a loss of their recorded membrane potentials and the synaptic responses with their postsynaptic cells (feeding motor neurons). CGC coupling and axonal fluorescence were lost after axonal irradiation. 4. The tonic firing rate of CGC axon spikes in peripheral nerve roots following bilateral soma kills was reduced to approximately 15\% of preirradiation levels (n = 2; from 52.5 +/- 3.75 spikes/min to 8.2 +/- 0.95 spikes/min; mean +/- SE) but spike activity was not completely eliminated. 5. The fictive feeding rhythm was evoked by depolarizing a modulatory neuron, the slow oscillator (SO), before and after laser irradiation. Thirty minutes after both the CGCs were irradiated (n = 8), the frequency of the SO-driven feeding rhythm was reduced. Mean fictive feeding rates were reduced from 8.3 to 4.5 cycles/min for soma kills (n = 3) and from 16.2 to 9.6 cycles/min for axonal kills (n = 5; P {$<$} 0.05). 6. The results suggest that the CGCs play a modulatory role in controlling the frequency of oscillation of the feeding central pattern generator (CPG) in Lymnaea. The SO could still drive a full fictive feeding rhythm after irradiation but at a reduced rate. At least in the soma kills, the residual spike activity retained in the distal branches of the CGCs appeared sufficient to allow the SO to drive this slow rhythm.},

  abstract = {1. We used intracellular recording techniques to examine the role of a novel type of protraction phase interneuron, the lateral N1 (N1L) in the feeding system of the snail Lymnaea stagnalis. 2. The N1Ls are a bilaterally symmetrical pair of electrotonically coupled interneurons located in the buccal ganglia. Each N1L sends a single axon to the contralateral buccal ganglia. Their neurite processes are confined to the buccal neuropile. 3. In the isolated CNS, depolarization of an N1L is capable of driving a full (N1--{$>$}N2--{$>$}N3), fast (1 cycle every 5 s) fictive feeding rhythm. This was unlike the previously described N1 medial (N1M) central pattern generator (CPG) interneurons that were only capable of driving a slow, irregular rhythm. Attempts to control the frequency of the fictive feeding rhythm by injecting varying amounts of steady current into the N1Ls were unsuccessful. This contrasts with a modulatory neuron, the slow oscillator (SO), that has very similar firing patterns to the N1Ls, but where the frequency of the rhythm depends on the level of injected current. 4. The N1Ls' ability to drive a fictive feeding rhythm in the isolated preparation was due to their strong, monosynaptic excitatory chemical connection with the N1M CPG interneurons. Bursts of spikes in the N1Ls generated summating excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in the N1Ms to drive them to firing. The SO excited the N1M cells in a similar way, but the EPSPs are strongly facilitatory, unlike the N1L--{$>$}N1M connection. 5. Fast (1 cycle every 5 s) fictive feeding rhythms driven by the N1L occurred in the absence of spike activity in the SO modulatory neuron. In contrast, the N1L was usually active in SO-driven rhythms. 6. The ability of the SO to drive the N1L was due to strong electrotonic coupling, SO--{$>$}N1L. The weaker coupling in the opposite direction, N1L--{$>$}SO, did not allow the N1L to drive the SO. 7. Experiments on semintact lip-brain preparations allowed fictive feeding to be evoked by application of 0.1 M sucrose to the lips (mimicking the normal sensory input) rather than by injection of depolarizing current. Rhythmic bursting, characteristic of fictive feeding, began in both the SO and N1L at exactly the same time, indicating that these two cell types are activated in "parallel" to drive the feeding rhythm. 8. The N1L is also part of the CPG network. It Excited the N2s and inhibited the N3 phasic (N3p) and N3 tonic (N3t) CPG interneurons like the N1Ms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)}

  abstract = {Background: A number of studies have been done on movement imagination of motor sequences with a single limb. However, brain oscillatory patterns induced by movement imagination of motor sequences involving multiple limbs have not been reported in recent years. The goal of the present study was to verify the feasibility of application of motor sequences involving multiple limbs to brain-computer interface (BCI) systems based on motor imagery (MI). The changes of EEG patterns and the inter-influence between movements associated with the imagination of motor sequences were also investigated. Methods: The experiment, where 12 healthy subjects participated, involved one motor sequence with a single limb and three kinds of motor sequences with two or three limbs. The activity involved mental simulation, imagining playing drums with two conditions (60 and 30 beats per minute for the first and second conditions, respectively). Results: Movement imagination of different limbs in the sequence contributed to time-variant event-related desynchronization (ERD) patterns within both mu and beta rhythms, which was more obvious for the second condition compared with the first condition. The ERD values of left/right hand imagery with prior hand imagery were significantly larger than those with prior foot imagery, while the phase locking values (PLVs) between central electrodes and the mesial frontocentral electrode of non-initial movement were significantly larger than those of the initial movement during imagination of motor sequences for both conditions. Classification results showed that the power spectral density (PSD) based method outperformed the multi-class common spatial patterns (multi-CSP) based method: The highest accuracies were 82.86 \% and 91.43 \%, and the mean values were 65 \% and 74.14 \% for the first and second conditions, respectively. Conclusions: This work implies that motor sequences involving multiple limbs can be utilized to build a multimodal classification paradigm in MI-based BCI systems, and that prior movement imagination can result in the changes of neural activities in motor areas during subsequent movement imagination in the process of limb switching.},

CPGs can produce meaningful functional output in the absence of sensory inputs. Neocortical circuits could be considered analogous to CPGs as they have rich spontaneous dynamics that, similar to CPGs, are powerfully modulated or engaged by sensory inputs, but can also generate output in their absence. We find compelling evidence for this argument at the anatomical, biophysical, developmental, dynamic and pathological levels of analysis. Although it is possible that cortical circuits are particularly plastic types of CPG ('learning CPGs'), we argue that present knowledge about CPGs is likely to foretell the basic principles of the organization and dynamic function of cortical circuits.},

Furthermore, we study the toggle switch under the interaction of network and noise. Meanwhile, we show that network structure and noise play a vital role in the toggle switch based on network mean first passage time (NMFPT).

Conventional decoders revealed that the dynamics within each area encoded time equally well; however, the dynamics in striatum exhibited a higher degree of sequentiality. Analysis of premotor and striatal dynamics, together with a large set of simulated prototypical dynamical regimes, revealed that regimes with higher sequentiality allowed a biologically constrained artificial downstream network to better read out time. These results suggest that, although different strategies exist for encoding time in the brain, neural sequences represent an ideal and flexible dynamical regime for enabling downstream areas to read out this information.},

It is demonstrated that the IR pulses can reversibly shape or block locally initiated action potentials. Suppression of the AP amplitude and duration and decrease in axonal excitability by IR pulses are quantitatively analyzed. While the AP amplitude and duration decrease similarly during IR illumination, it is discovered that the recovery of the AP duration after the IR pulses is slower than that of the AP amplitude.

Single IR light pulses induce a membrane depolarization during the light pulses, which is followed by a hyperpolarization that can last up to 100 ms. The depolarization amplitude is dependent on the optical pulse duration, total energy deposition and membrane potential, but is insensitive to tetrodotoxin. The hyperpolarization reverses its polarity near the potassium equilibrium potential and is barium-sensitive. The membrane depolarization activates an action potential (AP) when the axon is near firing threshold, while the hyperpolarization reversibly inhibits rhythmically firing APs. In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that single and brief IR light pulses can evoke initial depolarization followed by hyperpolarization on individual motor axons.

We partitioned neural population activity into components pertaining to preparation, initiation and execution.

Rapid two-reach sequences involved the same set of neural events as individual reaches but with preparation for the second reach occurring as the first was in flight.

ABSTRACT={<p>Neuronal action potentials or spikes provide a long-range, noise-resistant means of communication between neurons. As point processes single spikes contain little information in themselves, i.e., outside the context of spikes from other neurons. Moreover, they may fail to cross a synapse. A burst, which consists of a short, high frequency train of spikes, will more reliably cross a synapse, increasing the likelihood of eliciting a postsynaptic spike, depending on the specific short-term plasticity at that synapse. Both the number and the temporal pattern of spikes in a burst provide a coding space that lies within the temporal integration realm of single neurons. Bursts have been observed in many species, including the non-mammalian, and in brain regions that range from subcortical to cortical. Despite their widespread presence and potential relevance, the uncertainties of how to classify bursts seems to have limited the research into the coding possibilities for bursts. The present series of research articles provides new insights into the relevance and interpretation of bursts across different neural circuits, and new methods for their analysis. Here, we provide a succinct introduction to the history of burst coding and an overview of recent work on this topic.</p>}}

@article{Stein2005,
abstract = {Traditionally, the rate of nerve impulses (spikes) over time was considered to be the main carrier of information in the nervous system. Therefore, any variability in the rate of response to a steady stimulus would reduce the information conveyed by a nerve cell. Many nerve cells fire with considerable variability, which would limit their ability to carry information to 2 or 3 bits in 1 s.With time-varying inputs containing the range of frequencies that the neuron responds to, values of information transmission of approximately 1 bit per spike have been calculated. For a neuron that fires tens or hundreds of spikes per second, much higher bit rates are possible than with steady inputs.Variability might also offer distinct advantages in preventing the entrainment of neurons to high-frequency signals. Enhanced sensitivity to weak signals has been proposed, which is known as 'stochastic resonance', as well as a role of variability in the method of Bayesian inference. Recent work on various sensory systems has emphasized the importance of timing, particularly that of first spikes, rather than the rate of firing over time.Rate coding might be more important in the motor system than precise timing. The variability in rate fluctuates with the mean rate (signal-dependent noise). The variability in the motor output in the presence of this noise can be minimized using optimal control theory.Optimal control theory predicts the form of many movements if a specific rule is assumed that relates the standard deviation in rate to the mean rate. This rule is not observed experimentally for either motor neurons or the motor cortex. However, the relationship between the standard deviation in muscle force and the mean force obeys the rule.The reason for the difference between the neural responses and the force output arises from the Henneman size principle. This states that the first recruited motor units are small and, hence, produce minor variations in force. Later motor units are larger and produce greater variations with the magnitude required by the optimal control theory.In the central nervous system, large excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) can cause the near synchronous firing of groups of cells that might be important in attention, as well as learning and memory. Interactions in some areas, such as the hippocampus, between ongoing oscillations and spike activity might be used by 'place neurons' to locate the position of the body in external space. Therefore, variability in the firing rate of individual neurons is not simply noise, but might have a range of functions in neurons throughout the nervous system.},
