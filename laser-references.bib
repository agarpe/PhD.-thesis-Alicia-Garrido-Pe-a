The intracellular neuronal activities are monitored with two-electrode current clamp, while the IR-induced temperature changes are measured by the open patch technique simultaneously. It is demonstrated that the IR pulses can reversibly shape or block locally initiated action potentials. Suppression of the AP amplitude and duration and decrease in axonal excitability by IR pulses are quantitatively analyzed. While the AP amplitude and duration decrease similarly during IR illumination, it is discovered that the recovery of the AP duration after the IR pulses is slower than that of the AP amplitude. An IR-induced decrease in the input resistance (8.8%) is detected and discussed together with the temperature dependent changes in channel kinetics as contributing factors for the inhibition reported here.},

   abstract = {The excitatory and inhibitory effects of single and brief infrared (IR) light pulses (2&#x00A0;&#x00B5;m) with millisecond durations and various power levels are investigated with a custom-built fiber amplification system. Intracellular recordings from motor axons of the crayfish opener neuromuscular junction are performed ex vivo. Single IR light pulses induce a membrane depolarization during the light pulses, which is followed by a hyperpolarization that can last up to 100 ms. The depolarization amplitude is dependent on the optical pulse duration, total energy deposition and membrane potential, but is insensitive to tetrodotoxin. The hyperpolarization reverses its polarity near the potassium equilibrium potential and is barium-sensitive. The membrane depolarization activates an action potential (AP) when the axon is near firing threshold, while the hyperpolarization reversibly inhibits rhythmically firing APs. In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that single and brief IR light pulses can evoke initial depolarization followed by hyperpolarization on individual motor axons. The corresponding mechanisms and functional outcomes of the dual effects are investigated.},

But while observational techniques have greatly advanced in the last century, techniques for perturbation that are matched to the speed and heterogeneity of neural systems have lagged behind. The technology of optogenetics represents a step toward addressing this disparity. Reliable and targetable single-component tools (which encompass both light sensation and effector function within a single protein) have enabled versatile new classes of investigation in the study of neural systems.

This assumes an instant equilibrium between reactants and a high-energy activated state1. In reality, equilibration occurs on timescales dependent on the molecules involved, below which such analyses break down1. The molecular timescale, normally too short to be seen in experiments, can be of a significant length for proteins. To probe it directly, we studied very rapidly folding mutants of the five-helix bundle protein λ6–85, whose activated state is significantly populated during folding. A time-dependent rate coefficient below 2 µs signals the onset of the molecular timescale, and hence the ultimate speed limit for folding2. A simple model shows that the molecular timescale represents the natural pre-factor for transition state models of folding.},

Here we investigate the biophysical mechanism underlying this phenomenon by careful examination of possible photobiological effects after absorption-driven light-tissue interaction. The rat sciatic nerve preparation was stimulated in vivo with a Holmium:yttrium aluminum garnet laser (2.12 μm), free electron laser (2.1 μm), alexandrite laser (750 nm), and prototype solid-state laser nerve stimulator (1.87 μm). We systematically determined relative contributions from a list of plausible interaction types resulting in optical stimulation, including thermal, pressure, electric field, and photochemical effects. Collectively, the results support our hypothesis that direct neural activation with pulsed laser light is induced by a thermal transient. We then present data that characterize and quantify the spatial and temporal nature of this required temperature rise, including a measured surface temperature change required for stimulation of the peripheral nerve (6°C-10°C). This interaction is a photothermal effect from moderate, transient tissue heating, a temporally and spatially mediated temperature gradient at the axon level (3.8°C-6.4°C), resulting in direct or indirect activation of transmembrane ion channels causing action potential generation. © 2007 by the Biophysical Society.},

Optical stimulation elicits compound nerve and muscle potentials similar to responses obtained with conventional electrical neural stimulation in a rat sciatic nerve model. Stimulation and damage thresholds were determined as a function of wavelength using a tunable free electron laser source (=2  to  10  µm) and a solid state holmium:YAG laser (=2.12  µm). Threshold radiant exposure required for stimulation varies with wavelength from 0.312  J/cm2  (=3  µm) to 1.22  J/cm2  (=2.1  µm). Histological analysis indicates no discernable thermal damage with suprathreshold stimulation. The largest damage/stimulation threshold ratios (>6) were at wavelengths corresponding to valleys in the IR spectrum of soft tissue absorption (4 and 2.1  µm). Furthermore, optical stimulation can be used to generate a spatially selective response in small fascicles of the sciatic nerve that has significant advantages (e.g., noncontact, spatial resolution, lack of stimulation artifact) over conventional electrical methods in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in neuroscience, neurology, and neurosurgery.},

Transcranial infrared laser stimulation (TILS) has shown effectiveness in improving human cognition and was investigated using broadband near-infrared spectroscopy (bb-NIRS) in our previous study, but the effect of laser heating on the actual bb-NIRS measurements was not investigated. To address this potential confounding factor, 11 human participants were studied. First, we measured time-dependent temperature increases on forehead skin using clinical-grade thermometers following the TILS experimental protocol used in our previous study. Second, a subject-averaged, time-dependent temperature alteration curve was obtained, based on which a heat generator was controlled to induce the same temperature increase at the same forehead location that TILS was delivered on each participant. Third, the same bb-NIRS system was employed to monitor hemodynamic and metabolic changes of forehead tissue near the thermal stimulation site before, during, and after the heat stimulation. The results showed that cytochrome-c-oxidase of forehead tissue was not significantly modified by this heat stimulation. Significant differences in oxyhemoglobin, total hemoglobin, and differential hemoglobin concentrations were observed during the heat stimulation period versus the laser stimulation. The study demonstrated a transient hemodynamic effect of heat-based stimulation distinct to that of TILS. We concluded that the observed effects of TILS on cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism are not induced by heating the skin.},

However, the mechanism behind these physiological effects is poorly understood. It is known that the fast thermal gradient induced by the infrared light is necessary for these biological effects. Therefore, this study tests the hypothesis that the fast thermal gradient induced in a cell by infrared light exposure causes a change in the membrane fluidity. To test this hypothesis, we used the membrane fluidity dye, di-4-ANEPPDHQ, to investigate membrane fluidity changes following infrared light exposure. Di-4-ANEPPDHQ fluorescence was imaged on a wide-field fluorescence imaging system with dual channel emission detection. The dual channel imaging allowed imaging of emitted fluorescence at wavelengths longer and shorter than 647 nm for ratiometric assessment and computation of a membrane generalized polarization (GP) value. Results in CHO cells show increased membrane fluidity with infrared light pulse exposure and this increased fluidity scales with infrared irradiance. Full recovery of pre-infrared exposure membrane fluidity was observed. Altogether, these results demonstrate that infrared light induces a thermal gradient in cells that changes membrane fluidity.},

   abstract = {The Cerebral Giant Cells (CGCs) are a pair of identifi ed modulatory interneurons in the Central Nervous System of the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis with an important role in the expression of both unconditioned and conditioned feeding behavior. Following single-trial food-reward classical conditioning, the membrane potential of the CGCs becomes persistently depolarized. This depolarization contributes to the conditioned response by facilitating sensory cell to command neuron synapses, which results in the activation of the feeding network by the conditioned stimulus. Despite the depolarization of the membrane potential, which enables the CGGs to play a key role in learning-induced network plasticity, there is no persistent change in the tonic fi ring rate or shape of the action potentials, allowing these neurons to retain their normal network function in feeding. In order to understand the ionic mechanisms of this novel combination of plasticity and stability of intrinsic electrical properties, we fi rst constructed and validated a Hodgkin-Huxley-type model of the CGCs. We then used this model to elucidate how learninginduced changes in a somal persistent sodium and a delayed rectifi er potassium current lead to a persistent depolarization of the CGCs whilst maintaining their fi ring rate. Including in the model an additional increase in the conductance of a high-voltage-activated calcium current allowed the spike amplitude and spike duration also to be maintained after conditioning. We conclude therefore that a balanced increase in three identifi ed conductances is suffi cient to explain the electrophysiological changes found in the CGCs after classical conditioning. © 2010 Vavoulis.},

A response to laser stimulation was readily evoked in normal hearing cochlea. However, no response was evoked in any profoundly deaf cochleae, for either acute or chronic deafening, contrary to previous work where a response was observed after acute deafening with ototoxic drugs. A neural response to electrical stimulation was readily evoked in all cochleae after deafening.

   abstract = {Over half of solar energy consists of near-infrared and a wide range of preventative mechanisms have been evolutionarily maintained in organisms to protect against effects of near-infrared. However, the biological effects of near-infrared have not been investigated in detail. Despite the essential requirement of a water-filter to imitate solar near-infrared filtered by atmospheric water, previous studies used near-infrared resources without a water-filter or a cooling system. With these methods, near-infrared energy is primarily absorbed in the superficial tissues, thus these approaches are unable to sufficiently evaluate the biological effects of solar near-infrared that reaches human tissue. We have elucidated that near-infrared (1100-1800nm together with a water-filter that excludes wavelengths 1400-1500nm) non-thermally affects the skin into the deeper tissues. The biological effects of near-infrared have both beneficial applications and deleterious effects. Near-infrared induces collagen and elastin stimulation, which achieves skin rejuvination and skin tightening, and induces long-lasting vasodilation that may prevent vasospasm and be beneficial for ischemic disorders. Near- infrared also relaxes and weakens dystonic and hypertrophic muscles to reduce wrinkles and myalgia. Near-infrared is an essential tool in cancer detection and imaging, and induces drastic non-thermal DNA damage of mitotic cels, which may be beneficial for treating cancer. Activation of stem cells by near-infrared may be useful in regenerative medicine. However, continuous near-infrared exposure induces photoaging and potentially photocarcinogenesis. Humans have protective mechanisms against near-infrared on multiple levels, including perspiration, blisters, vasodilation, hair, skin, adipose tissue, and cotton or wool clothing. Further protection should be considered, as biological effects of near-infrared are significant, and standard sunscreens and glasses cannot successfully block near-infrared. This paper reviews the effects of near-infrared and introduces the new findings of near-infrared from a biological point of view.},

An identified interneuron, termed the input 3 interneuron (Ip.3.I), was found to be involved in the opening movement of the pneumostome (expiration), whereas another identified interneuron known as visceral dorsal 4 (V.D.4) caused its closure (inspiration). These cells have reciprocal inhibitory connections with each other, which accounts for their opposing effects on common follower motor neurons. In isolated brain preparations a third identified interneuron, right pedal dorsal 1 (R.Pe.D.1) initiated the respiratory cycle by the excitation of Ip.3.I. Whereas Ip.3.I in turn excited R.Pe.D.1, the connections between R.Pe.D.1 and V.D.4 were mutually inhibitory. Both Ip.3.I and V.D.4 were active during spontaneously occurring respiratory behavior as recorded from semi-intact preparations, and selective hyperpolarization of V.D.4 during such spontaneous activity disrupted the respiratory behavior. Regarding peripheral feedback, the mechanical stimulation of the pneumostome during its opening movements not only caused closure but also inhibited Ip.3.I in the middle of its discharge. Ip.3.I and V.D.4 were also found to be multifunctional, inhibiting both locomotor and whole body withdrawal neural networks. We conclude from these results that the rhythmic patterned activity underlying respiratory behavior in Lymnaea is generated centrally, and that the network described here therefore comprises a central pattern generator. © 1991, Springer-Verlag.

   abstract = {Connections between neurons called synapses are the key components underlying all nervous system functions of animals and humans. However, important genetic information on the formation and plasticity of one type, the electrical (gap junction-mediated) synapse, is understudied in many invertebrates. In the present study, we set forth to identify and characterize the gap junction-encoding gene innexin in the central nervous system (CNS) of the mollusk pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. With PCR, 3 and 5 RACE, and BLAST searches, we identified eight innexin genes in the L. stagnalis genome, named Lst Inx1-Lst Inx8. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the L. stagnalis innexin genes originated from a single copy in the common ancestor of molluskan species by multiple gene duplication events and have been maintained in L. stagnalis since they were generated. The paralogous innexin genes demonstrate distinct expression patterns among tissues. In addition, one paralog, Lst Inx1, exhibits heterogeneity in cells and ganglia, suggesting the occurrence of functional diversification after gene duplication. These results introduce possibilities to study an intriguing potential relationship between innexin paralog expression and cell-specific functional outputs such as heterogenic ability to form channels and exhibit synapse plasticity. The L. stagnalis CNS contains large neurons and functionally defined networks for behaviors; with the introduction of L. stagnalis in the gap junction gene field, we are providing novel opportunities to combine genetic research with direct investigations of functional outcomes at the cellular, synaptic, and behavioral levels.},

   abstract = {The pair of giant reciprocally coupled neurons VD1 and RPaD2 within the CNS of the freshwater pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis was used to analyse the effect of hydrogen peroxide on gap-junction connection. Electrical activity of VD1/RPaD2 was recorded with intracellular microelectrodes in order to analyse gap-junction signalling. Hydrogen peroxide application (1 9 10-4 M) results in a rapid, 1.3-fold, increase in VD1/RPaD2 spiking frequency within 30 s after application. This was accompanied by a slight reduction in action potential amplitude. In addition, H 2 O 2 induced a significant reduction in the steady-state bidirectional coupling ratio between the neurons. The maximal reduction in the coupling ratio, 1.8-1.9 fold, was measured 3 min after H 2 O 2 application. However, the network input resistance did not undergo a detectable change. The voltage-gated Ca 2? channel blocker, nifedi-pine (1 9 10-4 M), abolished the effect of H 2 O 2 on the coupling ratio and firing frequency. All the effects of H 2 O 2 were reversible, that is, washing the preparation with standard physiological saline restored the properties of the neuronal coupling to the pre-treatment value. These data are consistent with a dynamic modulation of the gap-junction properties by H 2 O 2 between these two neurons.},

   abstract = {Optical stimulation has enabled important advances in the study of brain function and other biological processes, and holds promise for medical applications ranging from hearing restoration to cardiac pace making. In particular, pulsed laser stimulation using infrared wavelengths >1.5 μm has therapeutic potential based on its ability to directly stimulate nerves and muscles without any genetic or chemical pre-treatment. However, the mechanism of infrared stimulation has been a mystery, hindering its path to the clinic. Here we show that infrared light excites cells through a novel, highly general electrostatic mechanism. Infrared pulses are absorbed by water, producing a rapid local increase in temperature. This heating reversibly alters the electrical capacitance of the plasma membrane, depolarizing the target cell. This mechanism is fully reversible and requires only the most basic properties of cell membranes. Our findings underscore the generality of pulsed infrared stimulation and its medical potential. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background: Transcranial laser stimulation is a novel method of noninvasive brain stimulation found safe and effective for improving prefrontal cortex neurocognitive functions in healthy young adults. This method is different from electric and magnetic stimulation because it causes the photonic oxidation of cytochrome-c-oxidase, the rate-limiting enzyme for oxygen consumption and the major intracellular acceptor of photons from near-infrared light. This photobiomodulation effect promotes mitochondrial respiration, cerebrovascular oxygenation and neurocognitive function. Pilot studies suggest that transcranial photobiomodulation may also induce beneficial effects in aging individuals. Objectives: Randomized, sham-controlled study to test photobiomodulation effects caused by laser stimulation on cytochrome-c-oxidase oxidation and hemoglobin oxygenation in the prefrontal cortex of 68 healthy younger and older adults, ages 18–85. Methods: Broadband near-infrared spectroscopy was used for the noninvasive quantification of bilateral cortical changes in oxidized cytochrome-c-oxidase and hemoglobin oxygenation before, during and after 1064-nm wavelength laser (IR-A laser, area: 13.6 cm2, power density: 250 mW/cm2) or sham stimulation of the right anterior prefrontal cortex (Brodmann Area 10). Results: As compared to sham control, there was a significant laser-induced increase in oxidized cytochrome-c-oxidase during laser stimulation, followed by a significant post-stimulation increase in oxygenated hemoglobin and a decrease in deoxygenated hemoglobin. Furthermore, there was a greater laser-induced effect on cytochrome-c-oxidase with increasing age, while laser-induced effects on cerebral hemodynamics decreased with increasing age. No adverse laser effects were found. Conclusion: The findings support the use of transcranial photobiomodulation for cerebral oxygenation and alleviation of age-related decline in mitochondrial respiration. They justify further research on its therapeutic potential in neurologic and psychiatric diseases.},

   abstract = {The crab Cancer borealis undergoes large daily fluctuations in environmental temperature (8-24uC) and must maintain appropriate neural function in the face of this perturbation. In the pyloric circuit of the crab stomatogastric ganglion, we pharmacologically isolated the pacemaker kernel (the AB and PD neurons) and characterized its behavior in response to temperature ramps from 7uC to 31uC. For moderate temperatures, the pacemaker displayed a frequency-temperature curve statistically indistinguishable from that of the intact circuit, and like the intact circuit maintained a constant duty cycle. At high temperatures (above 23uC), a variety of different behaviors were seen: in some preparations the pacemaker increased in frequency, in some it slowed, and in many preparations the pacemaker stopped oscillating (''crashed''). Furthermore, these crashes seemed to fall into two qualitatively different classes. Additionally, the animal-to-animal variability in frequency increased at high temperatures. We used a series of Morris-Lecar mathematical models to gain insight into these phenomena. The biophysical components of the final model have temperature sensitivities similar to those found in nature, and can crash via two qualitatively different mechanisms that resemble those observed experimentally. The crash type is determined by the precise parameters of the model at the reference temperature, 11uC, which could explain why some preparations seem to crash in one way and some in another. Furthermore, even models with very similar behavior at the reference temperature diverge greatly at high temperatures, resembling the experimental observations.},

   abstract = {Electrical stimulation has been used for decades in devices such as pacemakers, cochlear implants and more recently for deep brain and retinal stimulation and electroceutical treatment of disease. However, current spread from the electrodes limits the precision of neural activation, leading to a low quality therapeutic outcome or undesired side-effects. Alternative methods of neural stimulation such as optical stimulation offer the potential to deliver higher spatial resolution of neural activation. Direct optical stimulation is possible with infrared light, while visible light can be used to activate neurons if the neural tissue is genetically modified with a light sensitive ion channel. Experimentally, both methods have resulted in highly precise stimulation with little spread of activation at least in the cochlea, each with advantages and disadvantages. Infrared neural stimulation does not require modification of the neural tissue, but has very high power requirements. Optogenetics can achieve precision of activation with lower power, but only in conjunction with targeted insertion of a light sensitive ion channel into the nervous system via gene therapy. This review will examine the advantages and limitations of optical stimulation of neural tissue, using the cochlea as an exemplary model and recent developments for retinal and deep brain stimulation.},

abstract = {Hybrid circuits built by creating mono- or bi-directional interactions among living cells and model neurons and synapses are an effective way to study neuron, synaptic and neural network dynamics. However, hybrid circuit technology has been largely underused in the context of neuroscience studies mainly because of the inherent difficulty in implementing and tuning this type of interactions. In this paper, we present a set of algorithms for the automatic adaptation of model neurons and connections in the creation of hybrid circuits with living neural networks. The algorithms perform model time and amplitude scaling, real-time drift adaptation, goal-driven synaptic and model tuning/calibration and also automatic parameter mapping. These algorithms have been implemented in RTHybrid, an open-source library that works with hard real-time constraints. We provide validation examples by building hybrid circuits in a central pattern generator. The results of the validation experiments show that the proposed dynamic adaptation facilitates closed-loop communication among living and artificial model neurons and connections, and contributes to characterize system dynamics, achieve control, automate experimental protocols and extend the lifespan of the preparations.},

abstract = {Biohybrid circuits of interacting living and model neurons are an advantageous means to study neural dynamics and to assess the role of specific neuron and network properties in the nervous system. Hybrid networks are also a necessary step to build effective artificial intelligence and brain hybridization. In this work, we deal with the automatized online and offline adaptation, exploration and parameter mapping to achieve a target dynamics in hybrid circuits and, in particular, those that yield dynamical invariants between living and model neurons. We address dynamical invariants that form robust cycle-by-cycle relationships between the intervals that build neural sequences from such interaction. Our methodology first attains automated adaptation of model neurons to work in the same amplitude regime and time scale of living neurons. Then, we address the automatized exploration and mapping of the synapse parameter space that lead to a specific dynamical invariant target. Our approach uses multiple configurations and parallel computing from electrophysiological recordings of living neurons to build full mappings, and genetic algorithms to achieve an instance of the target dynamics of the hybrid circuit in a short time. We illustrate and validate such strategy in the context of the study of functional sequences in neural rhythms, which can be easily generalized for any variety of hybrid circuit configuration. This approach facilitates both the building of hybrid circuits and the accomplishment of their scientific goal.},

   abstract = {<p> In the present study we combined electrophysiology with optical heat pulse stimuli to examine thermodynamics of membrane electrical excitability in mammalian vestibular hair cells and afferent neurons. We recorded whole cell currents in mammalian type II vestibular hair cells using an excised preparation (mouse) and action potentials (APs) in afferent neurons in vivo (chinchilla) in response to optical heat pulses applied to the crista (Δ T ≈ 0.25°C per pulse). Afferent spike trains evoked by heat pulse stimuli were diverse and included asynchronous inhibition, asynchronous excitation, and/or phase-locked APs synchronized to each infrared heat pulse. Thermal responses of membrane currents responsible for APs in ganglion neurons were strictly excitatory, with Q <sub>10</sub> ≈ 2. In contrast, hair cells responded with a mix of excitatory and inhibitory currents. Excitatory hair cell membrane currents included a thermoelectric capacitive current proportional to the rate of temperature rise (d T/d t) and an inward conduction current driven by Δ T. An iberiotoxin-sensitive inhibitory conduction current was also evoked by Δ T, rising in &lt;3 ms and decaying with a time constant of ∼24 ms. The inhibitory component dominated whole cell currents in 50% of hair cells at −68 mV and in 67% of hair cells at −60 mV. Responses were quantified and described on the basis of first principles of thermodynamics. Results identify key molecular targets underlying heat pulse excitability in vestibular sensory organs and provide quantitative methods for rational application of optical heat pulses to examine protein biophysics and manipulate cellular excitability. </p>},

Specifically, rapid temperature pulses were shown to increase membrane capacitance, causing capacitive currents that explain neural excitation, but the underlying biophysics is not well understood. Here, we show that an intramembrane thermal-mechanical effect wherein the phospholipid bilayer undergoes axial narrowing and lateral expansion accurately predicts a potentially universal thermal capacitance increase rate of ∼0.3%/°C. This capacitance increase and concurrent changes in the surface charge related fields lead to predictable exciting ionic displacement currents. The new MechanoElectrical Thermal Activation theory's predictions provide an excellent agreement with multiple experimental results and indirect estimates of latent biophysical quantities. Our results further highlight the role of electro-mechanics in neural excitation; they may also help illuminate subthreshold and novel physical cellular effects, and could potentially lead to advanced new methods for neural control.},

   abstract = {This study examined whether electrophysiological changes in the endogenous properties and connectivity of the modulatory serotonergic cerebral giant cells (CGCs) contributed to the age-related changes in feeding behavior of the pond snail, Lymnaea. With increasing age there was a decrease in spontaneous CGC firing rates and decreased excitability of the CGCs to both chemosensory stimulation (0.05 M sucrose applied to the lips) and direct intracellular current injection. These changes could be accounted for by a decrease in the input resistance of the neuron and an increase in the amplitude and the duration of the after-hyperpolarization. Decreases were also seen in the % of CGC pairs that were electrically coupled causing asynchronous firing. Together these changes would tend to reduce the ability of the CGCs to gate and control the frequency of the feeding behavior. Part of the ability of the CGCs to gate and frequency control the feeding network is to provide a background level of excitation to the feeding motor neurons. Recordings from B1 and B4 motor neurons showed an age-related hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential consistent with a deficit in CGC function. Increases were seen in the strength of the evoked CGC → B1 connection, however, this increase failed to compensate for the deficits in CGC excitability. In summary, age-related changes in the properties of the CGCs were consistent with them contributing to the age-related changes in feeding behavior seen in Lymnaea. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Background: Modulation of brain circuits by electrical stimulation has led to exciting and powerful therapies for diseases such as Parkinson's. Because human brain organization is based in mesoscale (millimeter-scale) functional nodes, having a method that can selectively target such nodes could enable more precise, functionally specific stimulation therapies. Infrared Neural Stimulation (INS) is an emerging stimulation technology that stimulates neural tissue via delivery of tiny heat pulses. In nonhuman primates, this optical method provides focal intensity-dependent stimulation of the brain without tissue damage. However, whether INS application to the human central nervous system (CNS) is similarly effective is unknown. Objective: To examine the effectiveness of INS on human cerebral cortex in intraoperative setting and to evaluate INS damage threshholds. Methods: Five epileptic subjects undergoing standard lobectomy for epilepsy consented to this study. Cortical response to INS was assessed by intrinsic signal optical imaging (OI, a method that detects changes in tissue reflectance due to neuronal activity). A custom integrated INS and OI system was developed specifically for short-duration INS and OI acquisition during surgical procedures. Single pulse trains of INS with intensities from 0.2 to 0.8 J/cm2 were delivered to the somatosensory cortex and responses were recorded via optical imaging. Following tissue resection, histological analysis was conducted to evaluate damage threshholds. Results: As assessed by OI, and similar to results in monkeys, INS induced responses in human cortex were highly focal (millimeter sized) and led to relative suppression of nearby cortical sites. Intensity dependence was observed at both stimulated and functionally connected sites. Histological analysis of INS-stimulated human cortical tissue provided damage threshold estimates. Conclusion: This is the first study demonstrating application of INS to human CNS and shows feasibility for stimulating single cortical nodes and associated sites and provided INS damage threshold estimates for cortical tissue. Our results suggest that INS is a promising tool for stimulation of functionally selective mesoscale circuits in the human brain, and may lead to advances in the future of precision medicine.},

CA1 network responses of SWRs occurring during exploration (eSWR) and SWRs detected in waking immobility or sleep were similar. However, neuronal activity during eSWR was location dependent, and eSWR-related firing was stronger inside the place field than outside. The eSPW-related firing increase was stronger than the baseline increase inside compared to outside, suggesting a "supralinear" summation of eSWR and place-selective inputs. Pairs of cells with similar place fields and/or correlated firing during exploration showed stronger coactivation during eSWRs and subsequent sleep-SWRs. Sequential activation of place cells was not required for the reactivation of waking co-firing patterns; cell pairs with symmetrical cross-correlations still showed reactivated waking co-firing patterns during sleep-SWRs. We suggest that place-selective firing during eSWRs facilitates initial associations between cells with similar place fields that enable place-related ensemble patterns to recur during subsequent sleep-SWRs. ©2006 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Many species of cold-blooded animals experience substantial and rapid fluctuations in body temperature. Because biological processes are differentially temperature dependent, it is difficult to understand how physiological processes in such animals can be temperature robust [1–8]. Experiments have shown that core neural circuits, such as the pyloric circuit of the crab stomatogastric ganglion (STG), exhibit robust neural activity in spite of large (20°C) temperature fluctuations [3, 5, 7, 8]. This robustness is surprising because (1) each neuron has many different kinds of ion channels with different temperature dependencies (Q10s) that interact in a highly nonlinear way to produce firing patterns and (2) across animals there is substantial variability in conductance densities that nonetheless produce almost identical firing properties. The high variability in conductance densities in these neurons [9, 10] appears to contradict the possibility that robustness is achieved through precise tuning of key temperature-dependent processes. In this paper, we develop a theoretical explanation for how temperature robustness can emerge from a simple regulatory control mechanism that is compatible with highly variable conductance densities [11–13]. The resulting model suggests a general mechanism for how nervous systems and excitable tissues can exploit degenerate relationships among temperature-sensitive processes to achieve robust function.},

   abstract = {Neurostimulation has emerged as an effective means of treating a wide range of neurological disorders. Recent work has shown that precise delivery of infrared stimulation can modulate neural activity in a reversible manner. A possible mechanism underlying the excitatory effect of infrared stimulation is a localized elevation of temperature. To gain insight into how small elevations in temperature could potentially modulate neural activity, we explored the temperature sensitivity of the well-established Hodgkin-Huxley computational model of the squid giant axon. We relied on experimentally-derived temperature coefficients, or Q10 values, associated with gating kinetics for all the underlying currents and the maximum conductances, as well as the inherent temperature dependence of the equilibrium potentials of the ion conductances. While temperature elevations alone failed to induce action potentials in the computational model, small increases in temperature modulated the firing rate during constant current injection where greater than 30% increase in spike rate was observed with 2°C elevation in temperature. Furthermore, we observed that the rise in spike rate was largely due to the predicted temperature sensitivity of rate constants that form the basis of the gating parameters of the Hodgkin-Huxley computational model. Our findings suggest that the known biophysics of ion conductances may account, at least in part, for the excitatory effects of thermal elevations induced by exposure to infrared stimulation.},

   abstract = {Cochlear implants are currently the most effective solution for profound sensorineural hearing loss, and vestibular prostheses are under development to treat bilateral vestibulopathies. Electrical current spread in these neuroprostheses limits channel independence and, in some cases, may impair their performance. In comparison, optical stimuli that are spatially confined may result in a significant functional improvement. Pulsed infrared radiation (IR) has previously been shown to elicit responses in neurons. This study analyzes the response of neonatal rat spiral and vestibular ganglion neurons in vitro to IR (wavelength = 1,863 nm) using Ca2+imaging. Both types of neurons responded consistently with robust intracellular Ca2+([Ca2+]i) transients that matched the low-frequency IR pulses applied (4 ms, 0.25–1 pps). Radiant exposures of ~637 mJ/cm2resulted in continual neuronal activation. Temperature or [Ca2+] variations in the media did not alter the IR-evoked transients, ruling out extracellular Ca2+involvement or primary mediation by thermal effects on the plasma membrane. While blockage of Na+, K+, and Ca2+plasma membrane channels did not alter the IR-evoked response, blocking of mitochondrial Ca2+cycling with CGP-37157 or ruthenium red reversibly inhibited the IR-evoked [Ca2+]itransients. Additionally, the magnitude of the IR-evoked transients was dependent on ryanodine and cyclopiazonic acid-dependent Ca2+release. These results suggest that IR modulation of intracellular calcium cycling contributes to stimulation of spiral and vestibular ganglion neurons. As a whole, the results suggest selective excitation of neurons in the IR beam path and the potential of IR stimulation in future auditory and vestibular prostheses.},

In this study, we described the biophysical properties of an uncharacterized channel (U-type channel) and investigated the role of the channel in the rhythmic activity of a respiratory pacemaker neuron and the respiratory behaviour in adult freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis. Our results show that the channel conducts an inward leak current carried by Na+ (ILeak-Na). The ILeak-Na contributed to the resting membrane potential and was required for maintaining rhythmic action potential bursting activity of the identified pacemaker RPeD1 neurons. Partial knockdown of the U-type channel suppressed the aerial respiratory behaviour of the adult snail in vivo. These findings identified the Na+ leak conductance via the U-type channel, likely a NALCN-like channel, as one of the fundamental mechanisms regulating rhythm activity of pacemaker neurons and respiratory behaviour in adult animals. © 2011 Lu, Feng.

Recently, infrared (IR) light was shown to inhibit peripheral nerves with high spatial and temporal specificity. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that IR can selectively and reversibly inhibit small-diameter axons at lower radiant exposures than large-diameter axons. We provide a mathematical rationale, and then demonstrate it experimentally in individual axons of identified neurons in the marine mollusk Aplysia californica, and in axons within the vagus nerve of a mammal, the musk shrew Suncus murinus. The ability to selectively, rapidly, and reversibly control small-diameter sensory fibers may have many applications, both for the analysis of physiology, and for treating diseases of the peripheral nervous system, such as chronic nausea, vomiting, pain, and hypertension. Moreover, the mathematical analysis of how IR affects the nerve could apply to other techniques for controlling peripheral nerve signaling.},

The key variable driving the current was the rate of change of temperature (dT/dt heat shock), not temperature itself. The photothermal heat shock current was voltage-dependent and was from thermally driven displacement of ions near the plasma membrane. The charge movement was rapid during the heat shock and slow during thermal relaxation, thus leading to an asymmetrical capacitive current that briefly depolarized the cell. A simple quantitative model is introduced to describe modulation of the membrane potential and facilitate practical application of optical heat shock stimuli. © 2014 Biophysical Society.},

In this report we show in the neuromuscular junction of Caenorhabditis elegans that application of a 500°C/s heat shock for 500 μs evoked ∼35 pA of excitatory current and injected ∼23 fC(femtocoulomb) of charge into the cell while raising the temperature only 0.25°C. The key variable driving the current was the rate of change of temperature (dT/dt heat shock), not temperature itself. The photothermal heat shock current was voltage-dependent and was from thermally driven displacement of ions near the plasma membrane. The charge movement was rapid during the heat shock and slow during thermal relaxation, thus leading to an asymmetrical capacitive current that briefly depolarized the cell. A simple quantitative model is introduced to describe modulation of the membrane potential and facilitate practical application of optical heat shock stimuli. © 2014 Biophysical Society.},

   abstract = {Objectives: We provide an appraisal of recent research on stimulation of the auditory system with light. In particular, we discuss direct infrared stimulation and ongoing controversies regarding the feasibility of this modality. We also discuss advancements and barriers to the development of an optical cochlear implant. Methods: This is a review article that covers relevant animal studies. Results: The auditory system has been stimulated with infrared light, and in a much more spatially selective manner than with electrical stimulation. However, there are experiments from other labs that have not been able to reproduce these results. This has resulted in an ongoing controversy regarding the feasibility of infrared stimulation, and the reasons for these experimental differences still require explanation. The neural response characteristics also appear to be much different than with electrical stimulation. The electrical stimulation paradigms used for modern cochlear implants do not apply well to optical stimulation and new coding strategies are under development. Stimulation with infrared light brings the risk of heat accumulation in the tissue at high pulse repetition rates, so optimal pulse shapes and combined optical/electrical stimulation are being investigated to mitigate this. Optogenetics is another promising technique, which makes neurons more sensitive to light stimulation by inserting light sensitive ion channels via viral vectors. Challenges of optogenetics include the expression of light sensitive channels in sufficient density in the target neurons, and the risk of damaging neurons by the expression of a foreign protein. Conclusion: Optical stimulation of the nervous system is a promising new field, and there has been progress toward the development of a cochlear implant that takes advantage of the benefits of optical stimulation. There are barriers, and controversies, but so far none that seem intractable. Level of evidence: NA (animal studies and basic research).},

   abstract = {Optical control of neuronal activity has a number of advantages over electrical methods and can be conveniently applied to intact individual neurons in vivo. In this study, we demonstrated an experimental approach in which a focused continuous near-infrared (CNI) laser beam was used to activate single rat hippocampal neurons by transiently elevating the local temperature. Reversible changes in the amplitude and kinetics of neuronal voltage-gated Na and K channel currents were recorded following irradiation with a single-mode 980 nm CNI-laser. Using single-channel recordings under controlled temperatures as a means of calibration, it was estimated that temperature at the neuron rose by 14°C in 500 ms. Computer simulation confirmed that small temperature changes of about 5°C were sufficient to produce significant changes in neuronal excitability. The method should be broadly applicable to studies of neuronal activity under physiological conditions, in particular studies of temperature-sensing neurons expressing thermoTRP channels. © 2008 Humana Press Inc.},

   abstract = {Near-infrared laser provides a novel nerve stimulation modality to regulate the cell functions. Understanding its physiological effect is a prerequisite for clinic laser therapy applications. Here, the whole-cell sodium (Na) channel kinetics of neuron cell was employed to determine the temporal roles of infrared laser. The Na currents were elicited by electrical pulses that were synchronized at the rising and falling edges of the 980 nm laser pulses, respectively, to investigate the different infrared effect on cell functions. The time constants of activation (τ m) and inactivation (τ h) kinetics were extracted from fitting of the Na current (m3h) according to the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model. By comparing the time constants without and with the laser irradiation, we obtained that laser pulses changed the Na current kinetics by accelerating τ h-phase and slowing down τ m-phase at the beginning of the laser pulse, whereas both phases were accelerated at the end of the pulse. After relating the ratios of the time constants to the temperature characteristics of Na channel by Q 10, we found that the accelerating in Na current kinetics could be related to the average temperature of extracellular solution in the corresponding time span by choosing Q 10 = 2.6. The results of this study demonstrated that there was a positive correlation between the acceleration of the Na current kinetics and increases in temperature of the extracellular solution. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

In this context, the development of novel protocols, their implementation in bioinformatics toolboxes and their application to different description levels open up a wide range of possibilities in the study of biological systems. We developed a methodology for studying biological signals representing them as temporal sequences of binary events. A specific sequence of these events (code) is chosen to deliver a predefined stimulation in a closed-loop manner. The response to this code-driven stimulation can be used to characterize the system. This methodology was implemented in a real time toolbox and tested in the context of electric fish signaling. We show that while there are codes that evoke a response that cannot be distinguished from a control recording without stimulation, other codes evoke a characteristic distinct response. We also compare the code-driven response to open-loop stimulation. The discussed experiments validate the proposed methodology and the software toolbox.},

We have investigated the effect of MLS (Multiwave Locked System) laser near-infrared irradiation on cell membrane structure, functional properties, and free radical generation using human red blood cells and breast cancer MCF-4 cells. The cells were irradiated with low-intensity MLS near-infrared (simultaneously 808 nm, continuous emission and 905 nm, pulse emission, pulse-wave frequency, 1,000 or 2,000 Hz) laser light at light doses from 0 to 15 J (average power density 212.5 mW/cm(2), spot size was 3.18 cm(2)) at 22 °C, the activity membrane bound acetylcholinesterase, cell stability, anti-oxidative activity, and free radical generation were the parameters used in characterizing the structural and functional changes of the cell. Near-infrared low-intensity laser radiation changed the acetylcholinesterase activity of the red blood cell membrane in a dose-dependent manner: There was a considerable increase of maximal enzymatic rate and Michaelis constant due to changes in the membrane structure. Integral parameters such as erythrocyte stability, membrane lipid peroxidation, or methemoglobin levels remained unchanged. Anti-oxidative capacity of the red blood cells increased after MLS laser irradiation. This irradiation induced a time-dependent increase in free radical generation in MCF-4 cells. Low-intensity near-infrared MLS laser radiation induces free radical generation and changes enzymatic and anti-oxidative activities of cellular components. Free radical generation may be the mechanism of the biomodulative effect of laser radiation.},

   abstract = {Effects of near-infrared low-level laser (NIR LLL) on brain excitability have been seldom investigated. A few studies carried out so far showed that following several minutes of transcranial NIR LLL illumination, the output of the primary motor cortex area in humans, measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), is inhibited for at least half an hour. The effect seems to be dose dependent. Given that NIR LLL is known to boost metabolic activity in the illuminated neurons, the results may suggest that this allows for more efficient functioning of the cell membrane potential maintenance mechanisms which are then able to resist more effectively external perturbations (such as TMS). Alternatively, it may be that, due to the morphological complexity of the cerebral cortex coupled with the size of the area illuminated by a laser beam, transcranial LLL induces activation in a large population of the cortical cells of various functional features. Because of their abundance in the most superficial cortical layers, inhibitory interneurons may be the principal recipients of the NIR LLL effects thus causing an inhibition of the output from more deeply-seated, large pyramidal cells. Further investigations are needed to better understand these effects.},

It was shown to improve the outcome of acute stroke in both animal and human studies. In this study we evaluated whether transcranial laser stimulation (TLS) with NIR-LLL can modulate the excitability of the motor cortex (M1) as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Methods TLS was applied for 5 minutes over the representation of the right first dorsal interosseal muscle (FDI) in left primary motor cortex (M1), in 14 healthy subjects. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) from the FDI, elicited by single-pulse TMS, were measured at baseline and up to 30 minutes after the TLS. Results The average MEP size was significantly reduced during the first 20 minutes following the TLS. The pattern was present in 10 (71.5%) of the participants. The MEP size reduction correlated negatively with the motor threshold at rest. Conclusions TLS with NIR-LLL induced transitory reduction of the excitability of the stimulated cortex. These findings give further insights into the mechanisms of TLS effects in the human cerebral cortex, paving the way for potential applications of TLS in treatment of stroke and in other clinical settings. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Using standard intracellular recording techniques, we observed that 5-10 ms pulses of 1889 nm light depolarized the membrane potential for hundreds of milliseconds in more than 85% of dorsal root ganglion and nodose ganglion neurons tested. The laser-evoked depolarizations (LEDs) exhibited complex, multiphasic kinetics comprising fast and slow components. There was no discernable difference in the LEDs in intact ganglion neurons and in acutely isolated neurons. Thus, the LED sensor seems to reside within the neuronal membrane. The near-uniform distribution of responsive neurons increased membrane conductance, and the negative reversal potential value (-41±2.9 mV) suggests that LED is unrelated to the activation of heat-sensitive transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 channels. The long duration of LEDs favors an involvement of second messengers. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

In this study, a pulsed diode laser, with wavelength between 1.844-1.873 μm, was used to elicit compound action potentials (CAPs) from the auditory system of the gerbil. We found that pulse durations as short as 35 μs elicit a CAP from the cochlea. In addition, repetition rates up to 13 Hz can continually stimulate cochlear spiral ganglion cells for extended periods of time. Varying the wavelength and, therefore, the optical penetration depth, allowed different populations of neurons to be stimulated.

Low intensity, long duration laser irradiation produces a sustained depolarization, insensitive to sodium channel blockers yet sensitive to antioxidants. On the other hand, high intensity, short duration irradiation can induce fast depolarizations, which appear due to different mechanism.

   abstract = {Multichannel tetrode array recording in awake behaving animals provides a powerful method to record the activity of large numbers of neurons. The power of this method could be extended if further information concerning the intracellular state of the neurons could be extracted from the extra- cellularly recorded signals. Toward this end, we have simultaneously recorded intracellular and extracellular signals from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells and interneurons in the anesthetized rat. We found that several intracellular parameters can be deduced from extracellular spike waveforms. The width of the intracellular action potential is defined precisely by distinct points on the extracellular spike. Amplitude changes of the intracellular action potential are reflected by changes in the amplitude of the initial negative phase of the extracellular spike, and these amplitude changes are dependent on the state of the network. In addition, intracellular recordings from dendrites with simultaneous extracellular recordings from the soma indicate that, on average, action potentials are initiated in the perisomatic region and propagate to the dendrites at 1.68 m/s. Finally we determined that a tetrode in hippocampal area CA1 theoretically should be able to record electrical signals from ~1,000 neurons. Of these, 60-100 neurons should generate spikes of sufficient amplitude to be detectable from the noise and to allow for their separation using current spatial clustering methods. This theoretical maximum is in contrast to the approximately six units that are usually detected per tetrode. From this, we conclude that a large percentage of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells are silent in any given behavioral condition.},

   abstract = {In the ocean, the crab Cancer borealis is subject to daily and seasonal temperature changes. Previous work, done in the presence of descending modulatory inputs, had shown that the pyloric rhythm of the crab increases in frequency as temperature increases but maintains its characteristic phase relationships until it “crashes” at extremely high temperatures. To study the interaction between neuromodulators and temperature perturbations, we studied the effects of temperature on preparations from which the descending modulatory inputs were removed. Under these conditions, the pyloric rhythm was destabilized. We then studied the effects of temperature on preparations in the presence of oxotremorine, proctolin, and serotonin. Oxotremorine and proctolin enhanced the robustness of the pyloric rhythm, whereas serotonin made the rhythm less robust. These experiments reveal considerable animal-to-animal diversity in their crash stability, consistent with the interpretation that cryptic differences in many cell and network parameters are revealed by extreme perturbations. The crab Cancer borealis experiences substantial changes in ocean water temperature both daily and seasonally. Modulatory substances alter the range of temperatures over which one of the crab's rhythmic motor patterns can function normally.},

   abstract = {This article provides a mini review of the current state of infrared neural stimulation (INS), and new experimental results concerning INS damage thresholds. INS promises to be an attractive alternative for neural interfaces. With this method, one can attain spatially selective neural stimulation that is not possible with electrical stimulation. INS is based on the delivery of short laser pulses that result in a transient temperature increase in the tissue and depolarize the neurons. At a high stimulation rate and/or high pulse energy, the method bears the risk of thermal damage to the tissue from the instantaneous temperature increase or from potential accumulation of thermal energy. With the present study, we determined the injury thresholds in guinea pig cochleae for acute INS using functional measurements (compound action potentials) and histological evaluation. The selected laser parameters for INS were the wavelength (λ = 1,869 nm), the pulse duration (100 μs), the pulse repetition rate (250 Hz), and the radiant energy (0-127 μJ/pulse). For up to 5 hr of continuous irradiation at 250 Hz and at radiant energies up to 25 μJ/pulse, we did not observe any functional or histological damage in the cochlea. Functional loss was observed for energies above 25 μJ/pulse and the probability of injury to the target tissue resulting in functional loss increased with increasing radiant energy. Corresponding cochlear histology from control animals and animals exposed to 98 or 127 μJ/pulse at 250 Hz pulse repetition rate did not show a loss of spiral ganglion cells, hair cells, or other soft tissue structures of the organ of Corti. Light microscopy did not reveal any structural changes in the soft tissue either. Additionally, microcomputed tomography was used to visualize the placement of the optical fiber within the cochlea. © 2012 Wiley Periodicasl, Inc.},

The thermodynamic H-H model does have explicit terms for temperature. Do these endow the model with extrapolation for temperature? We utilised voltage clamp data for a voltage-gated K+ current, recorded at three different temperatures. The thermodynamic H-H model’s free parameters were fitted (Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm) to a data set recorded at one (or more) temperature(s). Then we assessed whether it could describe another data set, recorded at a different temperature, with these same free parameter values and its temperature terms set to the new temperature.

Despite the number of hypotheses such as mechanosensitive ion channels and intermembrane cavitation, they fail to explain all of the observed experimental effects. Here we are investigating the ionic concentration change as a prime mechanism for the neurostimulation by the ultrasound. Approach. We derive the direct analytical relationship between the mechanical deformations in the tissue and the electric boundary conditions for the cable theory equations and solve them for two types of neuronal axon models: Hodgkin–Huxley and C-fibre. We detect the activation thresholds for a variety of ultrasound stimulation cases including continuous and pulsed ultrasound and estimate the mechanical deformations required for reaching the thresholds and generating action potentials (APs). Main results. We note that the proposed mechanism strongly depends on the mechanical properties of the neural tissues, which at the moment cannot be located in literature with the required certainty. We conclude that given certain common linear assumptions, this mechanism alone cannot cause significant effects and be responsible for neurostimulation. However, we also conclude that if the lower estimation of mechanical properties of neural tissues in literature is true, or if the normal cavitation occurs during the ultrasound stimulation, the proposed mechanism can be a prime cause for the generation of APs. Significance. The approach allows prediction and modelling of most observed experimental effects, including the probabilistic ones, without the need for any extra physical effects or additional parameters.},

   abstract = {Over the past decade, optical methods have emerged for modulating brain functions as an alternative to electrical stimulation. Among various optical techniques, infrared neural stimulation has been effective via a thermal mechanism enabling focused and noninvasive stimulation without any genetic manipulation, but it results in bulk heating of neural tissue. Recently, it has been shown that neural cells can be activated more efficiently by pulsed near-infrared (NIR) light delivered to gold nanorods (GNRs) near the neural cells. Despite its potential, however, the biophysical mechanism underlying this GNR-enhanced NIR stimulation has not been clearly explained yet. Here, we propose an integrative and quantitative model to elucidate the mechanism by modeling heat generated from interaction between NIR light and GNRs, the temperature-dependent ion channels (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1; TRPV1) in the neuronal membrane, and a heat-induced capacitive current through the membrane. Our results show that NIR pulses induce abrupt temperature elevation near the neuronal membrane and lead to both the TRPV1-channel and capacitive currents. Both current sources synergistically increase the membrane potential and elicit an action potential, and which mechanism is dominant depends on conditions such as the laser pulse duration and TRPV1 channel density. Although the TRPV1 mechanism dominates in most cases we tested, the capacitive current makes a larger contribution when a very short laser pulse is illuminated on neural cells with relatively low TRPV1 channel densities.},

   abstract = {Analysis and control of neural circuitry requires the ability to selectively activate or inhibit neurons. Previous work showed that infrared laser light selectively excited neural activity in endogenous unmyelinated and myelinated axons. However, inhibition of neuronal firing with infrared light was only observed in limited cases, is not well understood and was not precisely controlled. Using an experimentally tractable unmyelinated preparation for detailed investigation and a myelinated preparation for validation, we report that it is possible to selectively and transiently inhibit electrically-initiated axonal activation, as well as to both block or enhance the propagation of action potentials of specific motor neurons. Thus, in addition to previously shown excitation, we demonstrate an optical method of suppressing components of the nervous system with functional spatiotemporal precision. We believe this technique is well-suited for non-invasive investigations of diverse excitable tissues and may ultimately be applied for treating neurological disorders. A long with further elucidation of mechanisms underlying neural function, burgeoning interest in deep brain stimulation 1 , pain management 2 , functional electrical stimulation 3 , and brain-computer interfaces 4 have created a demand for higher levels of neural specificity and control. Advances in electrical neural interface design have overcome many technical and biological challenges required to successfully excite and inhibit neural structures 5,6. Additionally, novel optical methods of spatially and temporally precise neural control are increasing in popularity 7,8. Optogenetics, a technique whereby light-responsive ion channels are introduced into targeted cells, is a promising new technology for exciting and inhibiting small groups of neurons with high spatial and temporal precision 7. Recently, this technique was also used to inhibit motor nerve and muscle activity in transgenic mice 9. While an excellent tool for preclinical discovery, optogenetics is currently unavailable for clinical use due to the need for genetic manipulation. In this work, we demonstrate the utility of an alternative optical technique for neural control using pulses of infrared light. The capability of pulsed infrared light to provide precise spatiotemporal activation of diverse excitable tissues has been shown 10-18. In addition to neural excitation, we recently observed instances of suppressed activity in response to infrared light, though the mechanisms of action were unclear 13,19. The response was reliable, repeatable, and occurred at a higher range of radiant energies than those used to induce excitation 19. Recently, in the toadfish, it was demonstrated that spontaneous activity of sensory neurons innervating the vestibular system could be excited or inhibited by infrared light 20. An attractive attribute of thermal neuromodulation, such as infrared neural stimulation, is the ability to both activate and suppress neural activity. Infrared-induced activation is believed to be the result of a brief (,ms) spatiotemporal gradient (dT/dt and dT/dx) 15,18 , whereas suppression is a function of an increase in baseline temperature (DT). By changing laser parameters (e.g. pulse width and frequency), one can either produce large, brief temperature transients for stimulation or relatively smaller temperature increases for suppression. While the discovery of controlled neural activation with infrared light was recently described, global temperature changes leading to block of nerve conduction, a phenomenon known as ''heat block'', has been investigated in both unmyelinated and myelinated nerves for decades 21,22. Recent modeling studies also indicate the potential for block of action potential (AP) initiation and propagation with local increases in nerve temperature 23. Here we demonstrate the use of infrared pulses to transiently suppress electrically initiated AP generation and propagation, as well as neuromuscular function with high spatiotemporal specificity relative to currently available means of functional neural control. This effect was repeatedly demonstrated in both the unmyelinated buccal nerve 2 (BN2) of Aplysia californica, where it was used to inhibit specific sub-populations of the motor axons OPEN SUBJECT AREAS: BIOTECHNOLOGY MOTOR CONTROL PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM INHIBITION},

   abstract = {Neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes were used to investigate mechanisms underlying transient changes in intracellular free Ca 2+ concentration ([Ca 2+] i) evoked by pulsed infrared radiation (IR, 1862 nm). Fluorescence confocal microscopy revealed IR-evoked [Ca 2+] i events with each IR pulse (3-4 ms pulse -1, 9.1-11.6 J cm -2 pulse -1). IR-evoked [Ca 2+] i events were distinct from the relatively large spontaneous [Ca 2+] i transients, with IR-evoked events exhibiting smaller amplitudes (0.88 ΔF/F 0vs. 1.99 ΔF/F 0) and shorter time constants (τ= 0.64 s vs. 1.19 s, respectively). Both IR-evoked [Ca 2+] i events and spontaneous [Ca 2+] i transients could be entrained by the IR pulse (0.2-1 pulse s -1), provided the IR dose was sufficient and the radiation was applied directly to the cell. Examination of IR-evoked events during peak spontaneous [Ca 2+] i periods revealed a rapid drop in [Ca 2+] i, often restoring the baseline [Ca 2+] i concentration, followed by a transient increase in [Ca 2+] i. Cardiomyocytes were challenged with pharmacological agents to examine potential contributors to the IR-evoked [Ca 2+] i events. Three compounds proved to be the most potent, reversible inhibitors: (1) CGP-37157 (20 μm, n= 12), an inhibitor of the mitochondrial Na +/Ca 2+ exchanger (mNCX), (2) Ruthenium Red (40 μm, n= 13), an inhibitor of the mitochondrial Ca 2+ uniporter (mCU), and (3) 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane (10 μm, n= 6), an IP 3 channel antagonist. Ryanodine blocked the spontaneous [Ca 2+] i transients but did not alter the IR-evoked events in the same cells. This pharmacological array implicates mitochondria as the major intracellular store of Ca 2+ involved in IR-evoked responses reported here.

   abstract = {Thermal stimulation with intense pulses of CO2 laser radiation has recently come into use as a method for generating robust cerebral evoked responses in man. Because the heat transient involved (at least 200°C/s) is at least an order of magnitude greater than that of most conventional thermal stimulators, we checked whether or not there might be anomalous activation of fiber types other than the well known cutaneous thermoreceptors. Recordings were made from primary afferent fibers in the rat sciatic nerve and second order somatosensory cells in the dorsal horn. Most of the laser-sensitive afferent fibers sampled were C polymodal nociceptors with lesser representation of other thermoreceptor types. There were no instances in which low threshold mechanoreceptors or other nonthermal afferent fibers were engaged. We conclude that the advantages of infrared laser stimulation are not compromised by a loss of receptor specificity. © 1982.},

   abstract = {Objective. To design and implement a setup for ex-vivo optical stimulation for exploring the effect of several key parameters (optical power and pulse duration), activation features (threshold, spatial selectivity) and recovery characteristics (repeated stimuli) in peripheral nerves. Approach. A nerve chamber allowing ex-vivo electrical and optical stimulation was designed and built. A 1470 nm light source was chosen to stimulate the nerve. A photodiode module was implemented for synchronization of the electrical and optical channels. Main results. Compound neural action potentials (CNAPs) were successfully generated with infrared light pulses of 200-2000 µs duration and power in the range of 3-10 W. These parameters determine a radiant exposure for stimulation in the range 1.59-4.78 J cm-2. Recruitment curves were obtained by increasing durations at a constant power level. Neural activation threshold is reached at a mean radiant exposure of 3.16 0.68 J cm-2 and mean pulse energy of 3.79 0.72 mJ. Repetition rates of 2-10 Hz have been explored. In eight out of ten sciatic nerves (SNs), repeated light stimuli induced a sensitization effect in that the CNAP amplitude progressively grows, representing an increasing number of recruited fibres. In two out of ten SNs, CNAPs were composed of a succession of peaks corresponding to different conduction velocities. Significance. The reported sensitization effect could shed light on the mechanism underlying infrared neurostimulation. Our results suggest that, in sharp contrast with electrical stimuli, optical pulses could recruit slow fibres early on. This more physiological order of recruitment opens the perspective for specific neuromodulation of fibre population who remained poorly accessible until now. Short high-power light pulses at wavelengths below 1.5 µm offer interesting perspectives for neurostimulation.},

   abstract = {The traditional approach to modulating brain function (in both clinical and basic science applications) is to tap into the neural circuitry using electrical currents applied via implanted electrodes. However, it suffers from a number of problems, including the risk of tissue trauma, poor spatial specificity, and the inability to selectively stimulate neuronal subtypes. About a decade ago, optical alternatives to electrical stimulation started to emerge in order to address the shortcomings of electrical stimulation. We describe the use of one optical stimulation technique, infrared neural stimulation (INS), during which short (of the order of a millisecond) pulses of infrared light are delivered to the neural tissue. Very focal stimulation is achieved via a thermal mechanism and stimulation location can be quickly adjusted by redirecting the light. After describing some of the work done in the peripheral nervous system, we focus on the use of INS in the central nervous system to investigate functional connectivity in the visual and somatosensory areas, target specific functional domains, and influence behavior of an awake nonhuman primate. We conclude with a positive outlook for INS as a tool for safe and precise targeted brain stimulation.},

In this paper we show that this concept can be easily generalized to build other kinds of closed-loop protocols beyond (or in addition to) electrical stimulation and recording in neurophysiology and behavioral studies for neuroethology. In particular, we illustrate three different examples of goal-driven real-time closed-loop interactions with drug microinjectors, mechanical devices and video event driven stimulation. Modern activity-dependent stimulation protocols can be used to reveal dynamics (otherwise hidden under traditional stimulation techniques), achieve control of natural and pathological states, induce learning, bridge between disparate levels of analysis and for a further automation of experiments. We argue that closed-loop interaction calls for novel real time analysis, prediction and control tools and a new perspective for designing stimulus-response experiments, which can have a large impact in neuroscience research. ©2012 Chamorro et al.},

   abstract = {Infrared neural stimulation (INS) is an alternative neurostimulation modality that uses pulsed infrared light to evoke spatially precise neural activity that does not require direct contact with neural tissue. With these advantages INS has the potential to increase our understanding of specific neural pathways and impact current diagnostic and therapeutic clinical applications. In order to develop this technique, we investigate the feasibility of INS (λ = 1.875. μm, fiber diameter = 100-400. μm) to activate and modulate neural activity in primary visual cortex (V1) of Macaque monkeys. Infrared neural stimulation was found to evoke localized neural responses as evidenced by both electrophysiology and intrinsic signal optical imaging (OIS). Single unit recordings acquired during INS indicated statistically significant increases in neuron firing rates that demonstrate INS evoked excitatory neural activity. Consistent with this, INS stimulation led to focal intensity-dependent reflectance changes recorded with OIS. We also asked whether INS is capable of stimulating functionally specific domains in visual cortex and of modulating visually evoked activity in visual cortex. We found that application of INS via 100. μm or 200. μm fiber optics produced enhancement of visually evoked OIS response confined to the eye column where INS was applied and relative suppression of the other eye column. Stimulating the cortex with a 400. μm fiber, exceeding the ocular dominance width, led to relative suppression, consistent with involvement of inhibitory surrounds. This study is the first to demonstrate that INS can be used to either enhance or diminish visual cortical response and that this can be done in a functional domain specific manner. INS thus holds great potential for use as a safe, non-contact, focally specific brain stimulation technology in primate brains. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Objective. Infrared light can be used to modulate the activity of neuronal cells through thermally-evoked capacitive currents and thermosensitive ion channel modulation. The infrared power threshold for action potentials has previously been found to be far lower in the in vivo cochlea when compared with other neuronal targets, implicating spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) as a potential target for infrared auditory prostheses. However, conflicting experimental evidence suggests that this low threshold may arise from an intermediary mechanism other than direct SGN stimulation, potentially involving residual hair cell activity. Approach. Patch-clamp recordings from cultured SGNs were used to explicitly quantify the capacitive and ion channel currents in an environment devoid of hair cells. Neurons were irradiated by a 1870 nm laser with pulse durations of 0.2-5.0 ms and powers up to 1.5 W. A Hodgkin-Huxley-type model was established by first characterising the voltage dependent currents, and then incorporating laser-evoked currents separated into temperature-dependent and temperature-gradient-dependent components. This model was found to accurately simulate neuronal responses and allowed the results to be extrapolated to stimulation parameter spaces not accessible during this study. Main results. The previously-reported low in vivo SGN stimulation threshold was not observed, and only subthreshold depolarisation was achieved, even at high light exposures. Extrapolating these results with our Hodgkin-Huxley-type model predicts an action potential threshold which does not deviate significantly from other neuronal types. Significance. This suggests that the low-threshold response that is commonly reported in vivo may arise from an alternative mechanism, and calls into question the potential usefulness of the effect for auditory prostheses. The step-wise approach to modelling optically-evoked currents described here may prove useful for analysing a wider range of cell types where capacitive currents and conductance modulation are dominant.},

   abstract = {In infrared neural stimulation (INS), laser-evoked thermal transients are used to generate small depolarising currents in neurons. The laser exposure poses a moderate risk of thermal damage to the target neuron. Indeed, exogenous methods of neural stimulation often place the target neurons under stressful non-physiological conditions, which can hinder ordinary neuronal function and hasten cell death. Therefore, quantifying the exposure-dependent probability of neuronal damage is essential for identifying safe operating limits of INS and other interventions for therapeutic and prosthetic use. Using patch-clamp recordings in isolated spiral ganglion neurons, we describe a method for determining the dose-dependent damage probabilities of individual neurons in response to both acute and cumulative infrared exposure parameters based on changes in injection current. The results identify a local thermal damage threshold at approximately 60 &#x00B0;C, which is in keeping with previous literature and supports the claim that damage during INS is a purely thermal phenomenon. In principle this method can be applied to any potentially injurious stimuli, allowing for the calculation of a wide range of dose-dependent neural damage probabilities. Unlike histological analyses, the technique is well-suited to quantifying gradual neuronal damage, and critical threshold behaviour is not required.},

   abstract = {The vision of patients rendered blind by photoreceptor degeneration can be partially restored by exogenous stimulation of surviving retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Whereas conventional electrical stimulation techniques have failed to produce naturalistic visual percepts, nanoparticle-based optical sensors have recently received increasing attention as a means to artificially stimulate the RGCs. In particular, nanoparticle-enhanced infrared neural modulation (NINM) is a plasmonically mediated photothermal neuromodulation technique that has a demonstrated capacity for both stimulation and inhibition, which is essential for the differential modulation of ON-type and OFF-type RGCs. Gold nanorods provide tunable absorption through the near-infrared wavelength window, which reduces interference with any residual vision. Therefore, NINM may be uniquely well-suited to retinal prosthesis applications but, to our knowledge, has not previously been demonstrated in RGCs. In the present study, NINM laser pulses of 100 μs, 500 μs and 200 ms were applied to RGCs in explanted rat retinae, with single-cell responses recorded via patch-clamping. The shorter laser pulses evoked robust RGC stimulation by capacitive current generation, while the long laser pulses are capable of inhibiting spontaneous action potentials by thermal block. Importantly, an implicit bias toward OFF-type inhibition is observed, which may have important implications for the feasibility of future high-acuity retinal prosthesis design based on nanoparticle sensors.},

   abstract = {Lymnaea stagnalis Mollusc a b s t r a c t Electrically coupled neurons communicate through channel assemblies called gap junctions , which mediate the transfer of current from one cell to another. Electrical synapses ensure spike synchronization and reliable transmission, which influences bursting patterns and firing frequency. The present study concerns an electrically coupled two-neuron network in the gastropod mollusc, Lymnaea stagnalis. The neurons, designated Visceral Dorsal 1 (VD 1) and Right Parietal Dorsal 2 (RPD 2), are peptidergic, innervate aspects of the cardio-respiratory system, and show strong coupling, such that they fire synchronously. Using dual sharp-electrode current-clamp recording and morphological staining in isolated brain preparations, the hypothesis that the electrical synapse is necessary for accurate network output was tested. We found that both cells make extensive projections within and out of the brain, including across the visceral-parietal connective, which links VD 1 and RPD 2. Cutting this connective uncoupled the neurons and disrupted the firing rate and pattern of RPD 2 more than VD 1 , consistent with VD 1 being the master and RPD 2 the follower. The electrical synapse was inhibited by select gap junction blockers, with niflumic acid and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid decreasing the VD 1-RPD 2 and RPD 2-VD 1 coupling coefficients, whereas carbenoxolone, α-glycyrrhetinic acid, meclofenamic acid, and quinine were ineffective. There was little-to-no impact on VD 1 2RPD 2 firing synchrony or frequency when coupling was reduced pharmacologically. However, in the presence of gap junction blockers, suppressing the activity of VD 1 by prolonged hyperpolarization revealed a distinct, low-frequency firing pattern in RPD 2. This suggests that strong electrical coupling is key to maintaining a synchronous output and proper firing rate.},

   abstract = {Inner ear spiral ganglion neurons were cultured from day 4 postnatal mice and loaded with a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator (fluo-4,-5F, or-5N). Pulses of infrared radiation (IR; 1,863 nm, 200 µs, 200–250 Hz for 2–5 s, delivered via an optical fiber) produced a rapid, transient temperature increase of 6–12°C (above a baseline of 24–30°C). These IR pulse trains evoked transient increases in both nuclear and cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]) of 0.20–1.4 µM, with a simultaneous reduction of [Ca2+] in regions containing endoplasmic reticulum (ER). IR-induced increases in cytosolic [Ca2+] continued in medium containing no added Ca2+ (±Ca2+ buffers) and low [Na+], indicating that the [Ca2+] increase was mediated by release from intracellular stores. Consistent with this hypothesis, the IR-induced [Ca2+] response was prolonged and eventually blocked by inhibition of ER Ca2+-ATPase with cyclopiazonic acid, and was also inhibited by a high concentration of ryanodine and by inhibitors of inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (IP3)-mediated Ca2+ release (xesto-spongin C and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate). The thermal sensitivity of the response suggested involvement of warmth-sensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. The IR-induced [Ca2+] increase was inhibited by TRPV4 inhibitors (HC-067047 and GSK-2193874), and immunostaining of spiral ganglion cultures demonstrated the presence of TRPV4 and TRPM2 that colocalized with ER marker GRP78. These results suggest that the temperature sensitivity of IR-induced [Ca2+] elevations is conferred by TRP channels on ER membranes, which facilitate Ca2+ efflux into the cytosol and thereby contribute to Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release via IP3 and ryanodine receptors. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Infrared radiation-induced photothermal effects release Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum of primary spiral ganglion neurons. This Ca2+ release is mediated by activation of transient receptor potential (TRPV4) channels and involves amplification by Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release. The neurons immunostained for warmth-sensitive channels, TRPV4 and TRPM2, which colocalize with endoplasmic reticulum. Pulsed infrared radiation provides a novel experimental tool for releasing intracellular Ca2+, studying Ca2+ regulatory mechanisms, and influencing neuronal excitability.},

   abstract = {Closed-loop technologies provide novel ways of online observation, control and bidirectional interaction with the nervous system, which help to study complex non-linear and partially observable neural dynamics. These protocols are often difficult to implement due to the temporal precision required when interacting with biological components, which in many cases can only be achieved using real-time technology. In this paper we introduce RTHybrid (www.github.com/GNB-UAM/RTHybrid), a free and open-source software that includes a neuron and synapse model library to build hybrid circuits with living neurons in a wide variety of experimental contexts. In an effort to encourage the standardization of real-time software technology in neuroscience research, we compared different open-source real-time operating system patches, RTAI, Xenomai 3 and Preempt-RT, according to their performance and usability. RTHybrid has been developed to run over Linux operating systems supporting both Xenomai 3 and Preempt-RT real-time patches, and thus allowing an easy implementation in any laboratory. We report a set of validation tests and latency benchmarks for the construction of hybrid circuits using this library. With this work we want to promote the dissemination of standardized, user-friendly and open-source software tools developed for open- and closed-loop experimental neuroscience.},

   abstract = {Temperature affects the conductances and kinetics of the ionic channels that underlie neuronal activity. Each membrane conductance has a different characteristic temperature sensitivity, which raises the question of how neurons and neuronal circuits can operate robustly over wide temperature ranges. To address this, we employed computational models of the pyloric network of crabs and lobsters. We produced multiple different models that exhibit a triphasic pyloric rhythm over a range of temperatures and explored the dynamics of their currents and how they change with temperature. Temperature can produce smooth changes in the relative contributions of the currents to neural activity so that neurons and networks undergo graceful transitions in the mechanisms that give rise to their activity patterns. Moreover, responses of the models to deletions of a current can be different at high and low temperatures, indicating that even a well-defined genetic or pharmacological manipulation may produce qualitatively distinct effects depending on the temperature.},

Yet, development of clinical applications has been impeded by lack of information about the molecular mechanisms underlying the laser-induced neural response. Here, we directly address this question through pharmacological characterization of the biological response evoked by midinfrared irradiation of isolated retinal and vestibular ganglion cells from rodents. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings reveal that both voltagegated calcium and sodium channels contribute to the laser-evoked neuronal voltage variations (LEVV). In addition, selective blockade of the LEVV by micromolar concentrations of ruthenium red and RN 1734 identifies thermosensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid channels as the primary effectors of the chain reaction triggered by midinfrared laser irradiation.

   abstract = {Reduced graphene oxide nanomeshes (rGONMs), as p-type semiconductors with band-gap energy of ~1. eV, were developed and applied in near infrared (NIR) laser stimulation of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) into neurons. The biocompatibility of the rGONMs in growth of hNSCs was found similar to that of the graphene oxide (GO) sheets. Proliferation of the hNSCs on the GONMs was assigned to the excess oxygen functional groups formed on edge defects of the GONMs, resulting in superhydrophilicity of the surface. Under NIR laser stimulation, the graphene layers (especially the rGONMs) exhibited significant cell differentiations, including more elongations of the cells and higher differentiation of neurons than glia. The higher hNSC differentiation on the rGONM than the reduced GO (rGO) was assigned to the stimulation effects of the low-energy photoexcited electrons injected from the rGONM semiconductors into the cells, while the high-energy photoelectrons of the rGO (as a zero band-gap semiconductor) could suppress the cell proliferation and/or even cause cell damages. Using conventional heating of the culture media up to ~43. °C (the temperature typically reached under the laser irradiation), no significant differentiation was observed in dark. This further confirmed the role of photoelectrons in the hNSC differentiation.},

    abstract = { Electrical stimulation of nerve tissue and recording of neural electrical activity are the basis of emerging prostheses and treatments for spinal cord injury, stroke, sensory deficits, and neurological disorders. An understanding of the electrochemical mechanisms underlying the behavior of neural stimulation and recording electrodes is important for the development of chronically implanted devices, particularly those employing large numbers of microelectrodes. For stimulation, materials that support charge injection by capacitive and faradaic mechanisms are available. These include titanium nitride, platinum, and iridium oxide, each with certain advantages and limitations. The use of charge-balanced waveforms and maximum electrochemical potential excursions as criteria for reversible charge injection with these electrode materials are described and critiqued. Techniques for characterizing electrochemical properties relevant to stimulation and recording are described with examples of differences in the in vitro and in vivo response of electrodes. }

There have been revolutions, and new ones are brewing, but they do not turn on competing paradigms, anomalies, or the like. Instead, they turn exclusively on the development of new experimental tools. I adopt a metascientific approach and examine in detail the development of two recent neuroscience revolutions: the impact of engineered genetically mutated mammals in the search for causal mechanisms of “higher” cognitive functions; and the more recent impact of optogenetics and designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs). The two key metascientific concepts, I derive from these case studies are a revolutionary new tool’s motivating problem, and its initial and second-phasehook experiments. These concepts hardly exhaust a detailed metascience of tool development experiments in neuroscience, but they get that project off to a useful start and distinguish the subsequent account of neuroscience revolutions clearly from Kuhn’s famous model. I close with a brief remark about the general importance of molecular biology for a current philosophical understanding of science, as comparable to the place physics occupied when Kuhn formulated his famous theory of scientific revolutions.}

Novel experimental techniques in neuroscience research allow observing and interacting with neural activity at a variety of spatial and temporal scales and provide improved coverage and resolution. However, classical stimulus-response paradigms with offline analysis remain prevalent in most experimental studies. In this chapter, we discuss online event detection requirements in novel experimental protocols using closed-loop technologies that can improve neuroscience experiments in a complementary way to simply enhancing coverage and resolution. Closed-loop methods can help overcome the fundamentally partial observation nature of experimental neuroscience, help reveal neural computation mechanisms in transient neural dynamics, and help bridge between disparate levels of description. We review some examples of effective closed-loop interactions ranging from in vitro experiments to brain-computer interfaces and behavioral studies, and then discuss a common framework for effective online event detection in closed-loop experimental protocols.},

TMS-based clinical applications have been shown promising to treat neurological or psychiatric diseases. TMS works by inducing non-invasively electric currents in localized cortical regions thus modulating their excitability levels and ongoing activity patterns depending on stimulation settings: frequency, number of pulses, train duration and intertrain intervals. Proper use of TMS in the fundamental and clinical neuroscience research requires a deep understanding of its operational principles, risks, potential and limitations. In this article we present the principles through which TMS is thought to operate. Readers will be provided with the bases to be able to understand and critically discuss TMS studies and design hypothesis driven TMS applications for basic and clinical neuroscience. Moreover, some recently identified physiological phenomena which that can dramatically influence the efficacy and magnitude of TMS impact and technological and methodological developments to guide TMS interventions that are becoming mainstream in the field will be also reviewed.}

Furthermore, given the nonenzymatic rate–temperature dependency, all enzymes, regardless of their operation temperatures, become {\textgreater}10-fold less powerful catalysts per 25°C temperature increase.

abstract = {Background
Low-level light therapy (LLLT) with transcranial laser is a non-invasive form of neuroenhancement shown to regulate neuronal metabolism and cognition. Attention bias modification (ABM) is a cognitive intervention designed to improve depression by decreasing negative attentional bias, but to date its efficacy has been inconclusive. Adjunctive neuroenhancement to augment clinical effectiveness has shown promise, particularly for individuals who respond positively to the primary intervention.
Objective/hypothesis
This randomized, sham-controlled proof-of-principle study is the first to test the hypothesis that augmentative LLLT will improve the effects of ABM among adults with elevated symptoms of depression.
Methods
Fifty-one adult participants with elevated symptoms of depression received ABM before and after laser stimulation and were randomized to one of three conditions: right forehead, left forehead, or sham. Participants repeated LLLT two days later and were assessed for depression symptoms one and two weeks later.
Results
A significant three-way interaction between LLLT condition, ABM response, and time indicated that right LLLT led to greater symptom improvement among participants whose attention was responsive to ABM (i.e., attention was directed away from negative stimuli). Minimal change in depression was observed in the left and sham LLLT.
Conclusions
The beneficial effects of ABM on depression symptoms may be enhanced when paired with adjunctive interventions such as right prefrontal LLLT; however, cognitive response to ABM likely moderates the impact of neuroenhancement. The results suggest that larger clinical trials examining the efficacy of using photoneuromodulation to augment cognitive training are warranted.}

ABSTRACT={Multiple extracellular microelectrodes (multi-electrode arrays, or MEAs) effectively record rapidly varying neural signals, and can also be used for electrical stimulation. Multi-electrode recording can serve as artificial output (efferents) from a neural system, while complex spatially and temporally targeted stimulation can serve as artificial input (afferents) to the neuronal network. Multi-unit or local field potential (LFP) recordings can not only be used to control real world artifacts, such as prostheses, computers or robots, but can also trigger or alter subsequent stimulation. Real-time feedback stimulation may serve to modulate or normalize aberrant neural activity, to induce plasticity, or to serve as artificial sensory input. Despite promising closed-loop applications, commercial electrophysiology systems do not yet take advantage of the bidirectional capabilities of multi-electrodes, especially for use in freely moving animals. We addressed this lack of tools for closing the loop with NeuroRighter, an open-source system including recording hardware, stimulation hardware, and control software with a graphical user interface. The integrated system is capable of multi-electrode recording and simultaneous patterned microstimulation (triggered by recordings) with minimal stimulation artifact. The potential applications of closed-loop systems as research tools and clinical treatments are broad; we provide one example where epileptic activity recorded by a multi-electrode probe is used to trigger targeted stimulation, via that probe, to freely moving rodents.}

	abstract = {Synchronous spiking during cerebellar tasks has been observed across Purkinje cells: however, little is known about the intrinsic cellular mechanisms responsible for its initiation, cessation and stability. The Phase Response Curve ({PRC}), a simple input-output characterization of single cells, can provide insights into individual and collective properties of neurons and networks, by quantifying the impact of an infinitesimal depolarizing current pulse on the time of occurrence of subsequent action potentials, while a neuron is firing tonically. Recently, the {PRC} theory applied to cerebellar Purkinje cells revealed that these behave as phase-independent integrators at low firing rates, and switch to a phase-dependent mode at high rates. Given the implications for computation and information processing in the cerebellum and the possible role of synchrony in the communication with its post-synaptic targets, we further explored the firing rate dependency of the {PRC} in Purkinje cells. We isolated key factors for the experimental estimation of the {PRC} and developed a closed-loop approach to reliably compute the {PRC} across diverse firing rates in the same cell. Our results show unambiguously that the {PRC} of individual Purkinje cells is firing rate dependent and that it smoothly transitions from phase independent integrator to a phase dependent mode. Using computational models we show that neither channel noise nor a realistic cell morphology are responsible for the rate dependent shift in the phase response curve.},

The main advantage of this pair of optical tools is high functional selectivity, which conventional electrical stimulation lacks. Over the past 15 years, the mechanism, safety, and feasibility of optical stimulation techniques have undergone continuous investigation and development. When combined with other methods like optical imaging and high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging, the translation of optical stimulation to clinical practice adds high value. We review the theoretical foundations and current state of optical stimulation, with a particular focus on infrared neural stimulation as a potential bridge linking optical stimulation to personalized medicine. },

Here we review the last decade of MPM development and highlight how in vivo imaging has matured and diversified, making it now possible to concurrently monitor thousands of neurons across connected brain areas or, alternatively, small local networks with sampling rates in the kilohertz range. This review includes different laser scanning approaches, such as multibeam technologies as well as recent developments to image deeper into neuronal tissues using new, long-wavelength laser sources. As future development will critically depend on our ability to resolve and discriminate individual neuronal spikes, we will also describe a simple framework that allows performing quantitative comparisons between the reviewed MPM instruments. Finally, we provide our own opinion on how the most recent MPM developments can be leveraged at scale to enable the next generation of discoveries in brain function.},

Using electroencephalography ({EEG}), we found that a single session of {tPBM} significantly increases the power of the higher oscillatory frequencies of alpha, beta and gamma and reduces the power of the slower frequencies of delta and theta in subjects in resting state. Furthermore, the analysis of network properties using inter-regional synchrony via weighted phase lag index ({wPLI}) and graph theory measures, indicate the effect of {tPBM} on the integration and segregation of brain networks. These changes were significantly different when compared to sham stimulation. Our preliminary findings demonstrate for the first time that {tPBM} can be used to non-invasively modulate neural oscillations, and encourage further confirmatory clinical investigations.},

Our aims are to enable more laboratories to easily implement behavioral experiments, as well as to provide a platform for sharing stimulus protocols that permits easy reproduction of experiments and straightforward validation.

Targeted patch-clamp recording is a powerful method for characterizing visually identified cells in intact neural circuits, but it requires skill to perform. We previously developed an algorithm that automates “blind” patching in vivo, but full automation of visually guided, targeted in vivo patching has not been demonstrated, with currently available approaches requiring human intervention to compensate for cell movement as a patch pipette approaches a targeted neuron. Here we present a closed-loop real-time imaging strategy that automatically compensates for cell movement by tracking cell position and adjusting pipette motion while approaching a target. We demonstrate our system’s ability to adaptively patch, under continuous two-photon imaging and real-time analysis, fluorophore-expressing neurons of multiple types in the living mouse cortex, without human intervention, with yields comparable to skilled human experimenters. Our “imagepatching” robot is easy to implement and will help enable scalable characterization of identified cell types in intact neural circuits.}
