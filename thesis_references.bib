	abstract = {Dopamine activates two different receptors to produce variability in sign at an identified synapse. Chemical synaptic transmission was investigated at a central synapse between identified neurons in the freshwater snail, Lymnaea stagnalis. The presynaptic neuron was the dopaminergic cell, Right Pedal Dorsal one ({RPeD}1). The postsynaptic neuron was Visceral Dorsal four ({VD}4). These neurons are components of the respiratory central pattern generator. The synapse from {RPeD}1 to {VD}4 showed variability of sign, i.e., it was either inhibitory (monophasic and hyperpolarizing), biphasic (depolarizing followed by hyperpolarizing phases), or undetectable. Both the inhibitory and biphasic synapse were eliminated by low Ca 2+ /high Mg 2+ saline and maintained in high Ca 2+ /high Mg 2+ saline, indicating that these two types of connections were chemical and monosynaptic. The latency of the inhibitory postsynaptic potential ({IPSP}) in high Ca 2+ /high Mg 2+ saline was ∼43 ms, whereas the biphasic postsynaptic potential ({BPSP}) had ∼12-ms latency in either normal or high Ca 2+ /high Mg 2+ saline. For a given preparation, when dopamine was pressured applied to the soma of {VD}4, it always elicited the same response as the synaptic input from {RPeD}1. Thus, for a {VD}4 neuron receiving an {IPSP} from {RPeD}1, pressure application of dopamine to the soma of {VD}4 produced an inhibitory response similar to the {IPSP}. The reversal potentials of the {IPSP} and the inhibitory dopamine response were both approximately −90 {mV}. For a {VD}4 neuron with a biphasic input from {RPeD}1, pressure-applied dopamine produced a biphasic response similar to the {BPSP}. The reversal potentials of the depolarizing phase of the {BPSP} and the biphasic dopamine response were both approximately −44 {mV}, whereas the reversal potentials for the hyperpolarizing phases were both approximately −90 {mV}. The hyperpolarizing but not the depolarizing phase of the {BPSP} and the biphasic dopamine response was blocked by the d-2 dopaminergic antagonist (±) sulpiride. Previously, our laboratory demonstrated that both {IPSP} and the inhibitory dopamine response are blocked by (±) sulpiride. Conversely, the depolarizing phase of both the {BPSP} and the biphasic dopamine response was blocked by the Cl − channel antagonist picrotoxin. Finally, both phases of the {BPSP} and the biphasic dopamine response were desensitized by continuous bath application of dopamine. These results indicate that the biphasic {RPeD}1 → {VD}4 synapse is dopaminergic. Collectively, these data suggest that the variability in sign (inhibitory vs. biphasic) at the {RPeD}1 → {VD}4 synapse is due to activation of two different dopamine receptors on the postsynaptic neuron {VD}4. This demonstrates that two populations of receptors can produce two different forms of transmission, i.e., the inhibitory and biphasic forms of the single {RPeD}1 → {VD}4 synapse.},

	abstract = {Central pattern generators ({CPGs}) are networks underlying rhythmic motor behaviours and they are dynamically regulated by neuronal elements that are extrinsic or intrinsic to the rhythmogenic circuit. In the feeding system of the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, the extrinsic slow oscillator ({SO}) interneuron controls the frequency of the feeding rhythm and the N3t (tonic) has a dual role; it is an intrinsic {CPG} interneuron, but it also suppresses {CPG} activity in the absence of food, acting as a decision-making element in the feeding circuit. The firing patterns of the {SO} and N3t neurons and their synaptic connections with the rest of the {CPG} are known, but how these regulate network function is not well understood. This was investigated by building a computer model of the feeding network based on a minimum number of cells (N1M, N2v and N3t) required to generate the three-phase motor rhythm together with the {SO} that was used to activate the system. The intrinsic properties of individual neurons were represented using two-compartment models containing currents of the Hodgkin-Huxley type. Manipulations of neuronal activity in the N3t and {SO} neurons in the model produced similar quantitative effects to food and electrical stimulation in the biological network indicating that the model is a useful tool for studying the dynamic properties of the feeding circuit. The model also predicted novel effects of electrical stimulation of two {CPG} interneurons (N1M and N2v). When tested experimentally, similar effects were found in the biological system providing further validation of our model. © The Authors (2007).},

Electrophysiological and video recording methods were used to investigate the function of lip touch in feeding ingestion behavior of the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. Although this stimulus was used successfully as a conditioning stimulus ({CS}) in appetitive learning experiments, the detailed role of lip touch as a component of the sensory stimulus provided by food in unconditioned feeding behavior was never ascertained. Synaptic responses to lip touch in identified feeding motoneurons, central pattern generator interneurons, and modulatory interneurons were recorded by intracellular electrodes in a semi-intact preparation. We showed that touch evoked a complex but characteristic sequence of synaptic inputs on each neuron type. Touch never simply activated feeding cycles but provided different types of synaptic input, determined by the feeding phase in which the neuron was normally active in the rhythmic feeding cycle. The tactile stimulus evoked mainly inhibitory synaptic inputs in protraction-phase neurons and excitation in rasp-phase neurons. Swallow-phase neurons were also excited after some delay, suggesting that touch first reinforces the rasp then swallow phase. Video analysis of freely feeding animals demonstrated that during normal ingestion of a solid food flake the food is drawn across the lips throughout the rasp phase and swallow phase and therefore provides a tactile stimulus during both these retraction phases of the feeding cycle. The tactile component of the food stimulus is strongest during the rasp phase when the lips are actively pressed onto the substrate that is being moved across them by the radula. By using a semi-intact preparation we demonstrated that application of touch to the lips during the rasp phase of a sucrose-driven fictive feeding rhythm increases both the regularity and frequency of rasp-phase motoneuron firing compared with sucrose applied alone.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {One contribution of 16 to a discussion meeting issue 'Homology and convergence in nervous system evolution'. Comparisons of rhythmic movements and the central pattern generators ({CPGs}) that control them uncover principles about the evolution of behaviour and neural circuits. Over the course of evolutionary history, gradual evolution of behaviours and their neural circuitry within any lineage of animals has been a predominant occurrence. Small changes in gene regulation can lead to divergence of circuit organization and corresponding changes in behaviour. However, some behavioural divergence has resulted from large-scale rewiring of the neural network. Divergence of {CPG} circuits has also occurred without a corresponding change in behaviour. When analogous rhythmic behaviours have evolved independently, it has generally been with different neural mechanisms. Repeated evolution of particular rhythmic behaviours has occurred within some lineages due to parallel evolution or latent {CPGs}. Particular motor pattern generating mechanisms have also evolved independently in separate lineages. The evolution of {CPGs} and rhythmic behaviours shows that although most behaviours and neural circuits are highly conserved, the nature of the behaviour does not dictate the neural mechanism and that the presence of homologous neural components does not determine the behaviour. This suggests that although behaviour is generated by neural circuits, natural selection can act separately on these two levels of biological organization.},

We introduce one-and-two dimensional phase portraits to illustrate the behaviors, thus reducing the study of dynamical mechanisms to planar geometrical properties. We examined whether other mechanisms besides the escape and release mechanisms might be needed for some cases of reciprocal inhibition, and show that, within the confines of a simple two-dimensional cell model, escape and release are sufficient for all cases. We divided the behaviors of a single cell into six different types and examined the joint behaviors arising from every combination of pairs of cells with behaviors drawn from these six types. For the case of two quiescent cells or two cells each having plateau potentials, bifurcation diagrams demonstrate the relations between synaptic threshold and synaptic strength necessary for oscillations by escape, oscillations by release, or network-generated plateau potentials. Thus we clarify the relationship between plateau potentials and oscillations in a cell. Using the two dimensional cell model we examine 1:N beating between cells and find that our simple model displays many of the essential dynamical properties displayed by more sophisticated models, some of which relate to thalamocortical spindling.},

Recent work on vertebrates highlights the importance of neuromodulatory control pathways in enabling spinal cord and brain stem circuits to generate meaningful motor patterns. Because rhythmic motor patterns are easily quantified and studied, central pattern generators will provide important testing grounds for understanding the effects of numerous genetic mutations on behavior. Moreover, further understanding of the modulation of spinal cord circuitry used in rhythmic behaviors should facilitate the development of new treatments to enhance recovery after spinal cord damage.},

	abstract = {Background: A number of studies have been done on movement imagination of motor sequences with a single limb. However, brain oscillatory patterns induced by movement imagination of motor sequences involving multiple limbs have not been reported in recent years. The goal of the present study was to verify the feasibility of application of motor sequences involving multiple limbs to brain-computer interface ({BCI}) systems based on motor imagery ({MI}). The changes of {EEG} patterns and the inter-influence between movements associated with the imagination of motor sequences were also investigated. Methods: The experiment, where 12 healthy subjects participated, involved one motor sequence with a single limb and three kinds of motor sequences with two or three limbs. The activity involved mental simulation, imagining playing drums with two conditions (60 and 30 beats per minute for the first and second conditions, respectively). Results: Movement imagination of different limbs in the sequence contributed to time-variant event-related desynchronization ({ERD}) patterns within both mu and beta rhythms, which was more obvious for the second condition compared with the first condition. The {ERD} values of left/right hand imagery with prior hand imagery were significantly larger than those with prior foot imagery, while the phase locking values ({PLVs}) between central electrodes and the mesial frontocentral electrode of non-initial movement were significantly larger than those of the initial movement during imagination of motor sequences for both conditions. Classification results showed that the power spectral density ({PSD}) based method outperformed the multi-class common spatial patterns (multi-{CSP}) based method: The highest accuracies were 82.86 \% and 91.43 \%, and the mean values were 65 \% and 74.14 \% for the first and second conditions, respectively. Conclusions: This work implies that motor sequences involving multiple limbs can be utilized to build a multimodal classification paradigm in {MI}-based {BCI} systems, and that prior movement imagination can result in the changes of neural activities in motor areas during subsequent movement imagination in the process of limb switching.},

We recorded {EEG} from 58 scalp positions to investigate the temporal sequence and the time course of activation of these areas while violin players prepared to execute, executed, prepared to imagine, or imagined a musical sequence on a violin. During the preparation for the sequence in three of seven musicians investigated the bilateral frontal opercular regions became active earlier than the motor areas and in one of them simultaneously with the motor areas. In two of the musicians a rather variable pattern of activation was observed. The frontal opercular regions were also strongly involved throughout the period of music execution or imagining. The supplementary motor area was involved in both preparation for the sequence and during execution and imagining of the sequence. The left primary sensorimotor area was involved in the preparation and termination of the musical sequence for both execution and imagining. The right sensorimotor area was strongly involved in the preparation for and during the execution of the sequence. We conclude that the bilateral frontal opercular regions are crucial in both preparation for and during music execution and imagining. They may have "mirror neurone" properties that underlie observation or imagining of one's own performance.

This review article addresses the psychological processes and brain mechanisms that enable such rhythmic interpersonal coordination. First, an overview is given of research on the cognitive-motor processes that enable individuals to represent joint action goals and to anticipate, attend and adapt to other’s actions in real time. Second, the neurophysiological mechanisms that underpin rhythmic interpersonal coordination are sought in studies of sensorimotor and cognitive processes that play a role in the representation and integration of selfand other-related actions within and between individuals’ brains. Finally, relationships between social–psychological factors and rhythmic interpersonal coordination are considered from two perspectives, one concerning how social-cognitive tendencies (e.g. empathy) affect coordination, and the other concerning how coordination affects interpersonal affiliation, trust and prosocial behaviour. Our review highlights musical ensemble performance as an ecologically valid yet readily controlled domain for investigating rhythm in joint action.},

In part, this lack in understanding owes to the invasiveness of electrophysiological acquisition, the difficulty in their simultaneous recording over large cortical areas, and the absence of fully established methods for unbiased extraction of network information from these data. Here, we demonstrate a novel, data-driven approach to analyze spontaneous signal variations in electrocorticographic ({ECoG}) recordings from nearly entire hemispheres of macaque monkeys. Based on both broadband analysis and analysis of specific frequency bands, the {ECoG} signals were found to co-vary in patterns that resembled the {fMRI} networks reported in previous studies. The extracted patterns were robust against changes in consciousness associated with sleep and anesthesia, despite profound changes in intrinsic characteristics of the raw signals, including their spectral signatures.

	abstract = {Recent physiological studies of the neuronal processes underlying bimanual movements provide new tests for earlier functional models of bimanual coordination. The recently acquired data address three conceptual areas: the generalized motor program ({GMP}), intermanual crosstalk and dynamic systems models. To varying degrees, each of these concepts has aspects that can be reconciled with experimental evidence. The idea of a {GMP} is supported by the demonstration of abstract neuronal motor codes, e.g. bimanual-specific activity in motor cortex. The crosstalk model is consistent with the facts that hand-specific coding also exists and that interactions occur between the motor commands for each arm. Uncrossed efferent projections may underlie crosstalk on an executional level. Dynamic interhemispheric interactions through the corpus callosum may provide a high-level link at the parametric programming level, allowing flexible coupling and de-coupling. Flexible neuronal interactions could also underlie adaptive large-scale systems dynamics that can be formalized within the dynamic systems theory approach. The correspondence of identified neuronal processes with functions of abstract models encourages the development of realistic computational models that can predict bimanual behavior on the basis of neuronal activity.},

	abstract = {Central pattern generators ({CPGs}) are generally defined as networks of neurons capable of enabling the production of central commands, specifically controlling stereotyped, rhythmic motor behaviors. Several {CPGs} localized in brainstem and spinal cord areas have been shown to underlie the expression of complex behaviors such as deglutition, mastication, respiration, defecation, micturition, ejaculation, and locomotion. Their pivotal roles have clearly been demonstrated although their organization and cellular properties remain incompletely characterized. In recent years, insightful findings about {CPGs} have been made mainly because (1) several complementary animal models were developed; (2) these models enabled a wide variety of techniques to be used and, hence, a plethora of characteristics to be discovered; and (3) organizations, functions, and cell properties across all models and species studied thus far were generally found to be well-preserved phylogenetically. This article aims at providing an overview for non-experts of the most important findings made on {CPGs} in in vivo animal models, in vitro preparations from invertebrate and vertebrate species as well as in primates. Data about {CPG} functions, adaptation, organization, and cellular properties will be summarized with a special attention paid to the network for locomotion given its advanced level of characterization compared with some of the other {CPGs}. Similarities and differences between these networks will also be highlighted.},

	abstract = {Previously (Syed et al. 1991) we described the ventilatory behavior of the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis and identified motor neurons that innervate various muscles involved in this behavior. In the present study we describe an interneuronal network that controls ventilatory behavior in Lymnaea. An identified interneuron, termed the input 3 interneuron (Ip.3.I), was found to be involved in the opening movement of the pneumostome (expiration), whereas another identified interneuron known as visceral dorsal 4 (V.D.4) caused its closure (inspiration). These cells have reciprocal inhibitory connections with each other, which accounts for their opposing effects on common follower motor neurons. In isolated brain preparations a third identified interneuron, right pedal dorsal 1 (R.Pe.D.1) initiated the respiratory cycle by the excitation of Ip.3.I. Whereas Ip.3.I in turn excited R.Pe.D.1, the connections between R.Pe.D.1 and V.D.4 were mutually inhibitory. Both Ip.3.I and V.D.4 were active during spontaneously occurring respiratory behavior as recorded from semi-intact preparations, and selective hyperpolarization of V.D.4 during such spontaneous activity disrupted the respiratory behavior. Regarding peripheral feedback, the mechanical stimulation of the pneumostome during its opening movements not only caused closure but also inhibited Ip.3.I in the middle of its discharge. Ip.3.I and V.D.4 were also found to be multifunctional, inhibiting both locomotor and whole body withdrawal neural networks. We conclude from these results that the rhythmic patterned activity underlying respiratory behavior in Lymnaea is generated centrally, and that the network described here therefore comprises a central pattern generator. © 1991, Springer-Verlag.

They are the most prominent representatives of a system of neurons expressing a gene that is similar to the gene expressed in R15 of Aplysia californica. Both neuronal systems are involved in the regulation of cardiorespiratory phenomena. In the present study the axonal branches of {VD}1 and {RPD}2 were mapped using immunocytochemical and tracer studies. To this end the α1-antiserum (directed to one of the {VD}1/{RPD}2 neuropeptides) was used in combination with Lucifer yellow ({LY}) and Ni-lys tracers. In whole mount preparations of the {CNS}, immunostained axons of {VD}1 and {RPD}2 were observed to run to the pleural, cerebral and pedal ganglia and in several nerves. Upon {LY} injection of {VD}1 thin axon branches were observed in the internal right parietal nerve. These run to the skin in the mantle area near the pneumostome and osphradium. The skin of the lips appeared to receive a similar innervation via the lip nerves. Thick {LY} filled axons of {VD}1 and {RPD}2 were observed in the intestinal nerve. They could be traced to the heart region. The pericardial branch of the intestinal nerve innervates the pericardium and heart (Ni-lys tracing). Immunocytochemically, using the α1-antiserum, it was demonstrated that this nerve branch carries the axons of {VD}1 and {RPD}2 to the venous side of the auricle, where they enter the pericardial cavity and ramify in the auricle (but not in the ventricle). Many immunopositive varicosities were observed on the auricular muscle fibers. Comparison of the stainings in the auricle with those obtained with antisera to the cardioactive neuropeptides {FMRFamide} and {SCP} showed no colocalization. The functional significance of the axonal distribution patterns of {VD}1 and {RPD}2 and the morphological and functional homology of the neurons to R15 of Aplysia are discussed. © 1991.},

Results of the application of three different labelling techniques on wholemount preparations were compared with each other and with the serotonin content of the ganglia, measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Serotonin immunocytochemistry resulted in the highest number of labelled neurons, but the more recently developed in vivo method of 5,6- or 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine-induced pigmentation also proved to be a reliable technique for the visualization of serotonin-containing cell bodies. In comparison with these two techniques, the glyoxylic acid fluorescence method appeared to be less sensitive. The distribution and number of serotonin-containing neurons and biochemically measured serotonin in specific ganglia showed a close correlation. By combining the results of the three labelling techniques, a detailed map of serotonin-containing neurons was constructed, and this was compared with maps of identified neurons prepared from earlier electrophysiological studies. Previously described serotonergic neurons were consistently found, as well as several new serotonin-containirig cell types in the cerebral, visceral and parietal ganglia. A network of serotonin-containing inter- and intraganglionic axon tracts, and thin serotonergic fibres in the perineurium were also demonstrated.

	abstract = {Near-infrared laser provides a novel nerve stimulation modality to regulate the cell functions. Understanding its physiological effect is a prerequisite for clinic laser therapy applications. Here, the whole-cell sodium (Na) channel kinetics of neuron cell was employed to determine the temporal roles of infrared laser. The Na currents were elicited by electrical pulses that were synchronized at the rising and falling edges of the 980 nm laser pulses, respectively, to investigate the different infrared effect on cell functions. The time constants of activation (τ m) and inactivation (τ h) kinetics were extracted from fitting of the Na current (m3h) according to the Hodgkin-Huxley ({HH}) model. By comparing the time constants without and with the laser irradiation, we obtained that laser pulses changed the Na current kinetics by accelerating τ h-phase and slowing down τ m-phase at the beginning of the laser pulse, whereas both phases were accelerated at the end of the pulse. After relating the ratios of the time constants to the temperature characteristics of Na channel by Q 10, we found that the accelerating in Na current kinetics could be related to the average temperature of extracellular solution in the corresponding time span by choosing Q 10 = 2.6. The results of this study demonstrated that there was a positive correlation between the acceleration of the Na current kinetics and increases in temperature of the extracellular solution. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

To model the range of synaptic dynamics observed in experiments, we develop a flexible mathematical framework based on a linear-nonlinear operation. This model can capture various experimentally observed features of synaptic dynamics and different types of heteroskedasticity. Despite its conceptual simplicity, we show it is more adaptable than previous models. Combined with a standard maximum likelihood approach, synaptic dynamics can be accurately and efficiently characterized using naturalistic stimulation patterns. These results make explicit that synaptic processing bears algorithmic similarities with information processing in convolutional neural networks. Author summary Understanding how information is transmitted relies heavily on knowledge of the underlying regulatory synaptic dynamics. Existing computational models for capturing such dynamics are often either very complex or too restrictive. As a result, effectively capturing the different types of dynamics observed experimentally remains a challenging problem. Here, we propose a mathematically flexible linear-nonlinear model that is capable of efficiently characterizing synaptic dynamics. We demonstrate the ability of this model to capture different features of experimentally observed data.},

	doi = {10.1152/jn.00203.2017},
	abstract = {A fundamental question in comparative neuroethology is the extent to which synaptic wiring determines behavior vs. the extent to which it is constrained by phylogeny. We investigated this by examining the connectivity and activity of homologous neurons in different species. Melibe leonina and Dendronotus iris (Mollusca, Gastropoda, Nudibranchia) have homologous neurons and exhibit homologous swimming behaviors consisting of alternating left-right ({LR}) whole body flexions. Yet, a homologous interneuron (Si1) differs between the two species in its participation in the swim motor pattern ({SMP}) and synaptic connectivity. In this study we examined Si1 homologs in two additional nudibranchs: Flabellina iodinea, which evolved {LR} swimming independently of Melibe and Dendronotus, and Tritonia diomedea, which swims with dorsal-ventral ({DV}) body flexions. In Flabellina, the contralateral Si1s exhibit alternating rhythmic bursting activity during the {SMP} and are members of the swim central pattern generator ({CPG}), as in Melibe. The Si1 homologs in Tritonia do not burst rhythmically during the {DV} {SMP} but are inhibited and receive bilaterally synchronous synaptic input. In both Flabellina and Tritonia, the Si1 homologs exhibit reciprocal inhibition, as in Melibe. However, in Flabellina the inhibition is polysynaptic, whereas in Tritonia it is monosynaptic, as in Melibe. In all species, the contralateral Si1s are electrically coupled. These results suggest that Flabellina and Melibe convergently evolved a swim {CPG} that contains Si1; however, they differ in monosynaptic connections. Connectivity is more similar between Tritonia and Melibe, which exhibit different swimming behaviors. Thus connectivity between homologous neurons varies independently of both behavior and phylogeny. {NEW} \& {NOTEWORTHY} This research shows that the synaptic connectivity between homologous neurons exhibits species-specific variations on a basic theme. The neurons vary in the extent of electrical coupling and reciprocal inhibition. They also exhibit different patterns of activity during rhythmic motor behaviors that are not predicted by their circuitry. The circuitry does not map onto the phylogeny in a predictable fashion either. Thus neither neuronal homology nor species behavior is predictive of neural circuit connectivity.},

In this study, we described the biophysical properties of an uncharacterized channel (U-type channel) and investigated the role of the channel in the rhythmic activity of a respiratory pacemaker neuron and the respiratory behaviour in adult freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis. Our results show that the channel conducts an inward leak current carried by Na+ ({ILeak}-Na). The {ILeak}-Na contributed to the resting membrane potential and was required for maintaining rhythmic action potential bursting activity of the identified pacemaker {RPeD}1 neurons. Partial knockdown of the U-type channel suppressed the aerial respiratory behaviour of the adult snail in vivo. These findings identified the Na+ leak conductance via the U-type channel, likely a {NALCN}-like channel, as one of the fundamental mechanisms regulating rhythm activity of pacemaker neurons and respiratory behaviour in adult animals. © 2011 Lu, Feng.

	abstract = {1. The role of the paired serotonergic cerebral giant cells ({CGCs}) in the feeding system of Lymnaea was examined by electrophysiological and pharmacological techniques. 2. The firing characteristics of the {CGCs} were recorded by fine wires attached to their cell bodies in freely moving intact snails (in vivo recording) and their 'physiological' rates of firing determined during feeding and other behaviors. 3. The mean {CGC} firing rates recorded in vivo varied between 1 and 20 spikes/min but never reached the average rates seen in the isolated {CNS} (60-120 spikes/min). Maximum rates of firing were seen during bouts of radula biting/rasping movements characteristic of the consummatory phase of feeding (15 ± 1.69 spikes/min, mean ± {SE}, range 7-20 spikes/min), with lower rates seen during locomotion (6.7 ± 0.75 spikes/min; range 5-9 spikes/min. The cells were rarely active when the animal was quiescent (1.45 ± 0.91 spikes/min; range 0-2 spikes/min). 4. In vivo recorded {CGC} firing was phase locked to the feeding movements of the animal, with spikes occurring just before the opening of the mouth, during the protraction phase of the feeding cycle. 5. Evoking firing rates on the {CGCs} in the isolated preparation similar to those seen in vivo during rasping movements (7-20 spikes/min) did not elicit a fictive feeding pattern in an inactive preparation. Neither did bath application of 10-9 M serotonin (5-{HT}; the transmitter of the {CGCs}). 6. To allow the modulatory role of the {CGCs} to be examined during patterned activity, the fictive feeding pattern was evoked in the isolated preparation by injecting depolarizing current into a modulatory neuron, the slow oscillator ({SO}). 7. The tonic firing activity of the {CGCs} was accurately maintained by current injection in the isolated preparation at rates equivalent to that occurring during feeding, locomotion, and quiescence in the intact snail. This was possible where the {CGCs} became silent after 1-2 h. Only when the {CGCs} activity was maintained at a rate ({\textasciitilde}15 spikes/min) similar to that occurring during rasping, was the {SO} able to drive a full, high-frequency fictive feeding pattern (15-20 cycles/min). At lower rates of {CGC} firing, the {SO}- driven rhythm was either of lower frequency or no rhythm occurred at all ({CGCs} silent). 8. In many isolated preparations (80\%) the {CGCs} remained active, and it was difficult to maintain specific levels of tonic activity by current injection. Here attempts to completely suppress {CGC} activity produced a lowering of fictive feeding rates but did not lead to the complete loss of the {SO}-driven pattern in the isolated preparation. Residual levels of {CGC} activity (axon spikes recorded) were still likely to be present. 9. Low concentrations of 5-{HT} (10-9-10-8 M) perfused over the buccal ganglia allowed the {SO} to drive a full, high-frequency fictive feeding rhythm in preparations where the {CGCs} were already silent or spike activity had been suppressed by hyperpolarizing current injection. 10. Perfusion of a variety of serotonergic antagonists across the buccal ganglia [7-methyltryptamine (7- {MT}) and cinanserin], when the {CGCs} were tonically active, slowed the rate of the {SO}-driven motor program to values comparable with mean frequencies seen in the {CGC} spike suppression experiments. 11. It is concluded that the {CGCs} and their transmitter 5-{HT} have a modulatory rather than a command function in the feeding system of Lymnaea. One type of modulation (gating function) requires a sufficient level of activity in the {CGCs} to 'enable' a second type of neuron (the {SO}) to drive a feeding rhythm. Above this gating threshold (7 spikes/min), within the 7-to 20-spikes/min firing range, the {CGCs} influence the frequency of the motor pattern, a second type of modulatory function.},

The closed-loop adapts the maximum conductance of the inhibition to achieve a regularized rhythm departing from an otherwise highly irregular spiking-bursting activity. Our results show that the closed-loop conductance control can rapidly find the best connectivity that leads to the regularization goal. We also discuss several external stimuli that lead to regularized {CPG} rhythms. We argue that the proposed closed-loop approach can be used to control {CPG} rhythms in a wide variety of applications in experimental and theoretical research.},

	abstract = {We study the processing of weak signals in a realistic neural medium of spiking neurons by means of the stochastic resonance mechanism. Assuming a Hebbian prescription for the maximal synaptic conductances that balances ex-citatory and inhibitory synaptic connections, and short-term synaptic plasticity processes affecting such conductances, the system exhibits dynamical well-defined phases. This includes a memory phase, in which population of neurons remain synchronized, an oscillatory phase characterized by jumps between different synchronized populations of neurons, and an asynchronous noisy phase. Increasing noise in the medium when a weak input stimulates each neuron, intriguing phenomena occurs near all the transition points between phases resulting in the emergence of stochastic multi-resonance. This is shown to be quite robust, as it occurs for different levels of synaptic plasticity, type and number of stored patterns , and network topologies. Such robustness suggests that the behaviour shown by the models here should also be observable in actual systems, as a recent psy-chophysical experiment seems also indicate. Would this be the case, monitoring multi-resonance may help neuroscientists to identify and investigate the existence of phase transitions in the brain, which have been recently associated to some of its high level functions.},

	abstract = {Interference-based forgetting occurs when new information acquired either before or after a learning event attenuates memory expression (proactive and retroactive interference, respectively). Multiple learning events often occur in rapid succession, leading to competition between consolidating memories. However, it is unknown what factors determine which memory is remembered or forgotten. Here, we challenge the snail, Lymnaea, to acquire two consecutive similar or different memories and identify learning-induced changes in neurons of its well-characterized motor circuits. We show that when new learning takes place during a stable period of the original memory, proactive interference only occurs if the two consolidating memories engage the same circuit mechanisms. If different circuits are used, both memories survive. However, any new learning during a labile period of consolidation promotes retroactive interference and the acquisition of the new memory. Therefore, the effect of interference depends both on the timing of new learning and the underlying neuronal mechanisms. Michael Crossley et al. use the snail Lymnaea to investigate the factors involved in determining which memories are remembered or forgotten when multiple learning events happen close together. They find that timing of events and whether the same neuronal mechanisms are used are key factors in determining whether interference will occur.},

How the nervous system uses these graded perceptual shifts to select between opposed motor patterns remains enigmatic. Here, we challenged food-deprived and satiated Lymnaea to choose between two mutually exclusive behaviors, ingestion or egestion, produced by the same feeding central pattern generator. Decoding the underlying neural circuit reveals that the activity of central dopaminergic interneurons defines hunger state and drives network reconfiguration, biasing satiated animals toward the rejection of stimuli deemed palatable by food-deprived ones. By blocking the action of these neurons, satiated animals can be reconfigured to exhibit a hungry animal phenotype. This centralized mechanism occurs in the complete absence of sensory retuning and generalizes across different sensory modalities, allowing food-deprived animals to increase their perception of food value in a stimulus-independent manner to maximize potential calorific intake.},

In this study, we described the biophysical properties of an uncharacterized channel (U-type channel) and investigated the role of the channel in the rhythmic activity of a respiratory pacemaker neuron and the respiratory behaviour in adult freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis. Our results show that the channel conducts an inward leak current carried by Na+ ({ILeak}-Na). The {ILeak}-Na contributed to the resting membrane potential and was required for maintaining rhythmic action potential bursting activity of the identified pacemaker {RPeD}1 neurons. Partial knockdown of the U-type channel suppressed the aerial respiratory behaviour of the adult snail in vivo. These findings identified the Na+ leak conductance via the U-type channel, likely a {NALCN}-like channel, as one of the fundamental mechanisms regulating rhythm activity of pacemaker neurons and respiratory behaviour in adult animals. © 2011 Lu, Feng.

His basic concepts on the neuron as the main building block of the central nervous system, the dynamic polarization principle as a way to understand how neurons deal with ongoing active processes, and brain local structural arrangements as a result of the functional specialization of selected neural circuits are concepts still surviving in present research papers dealing with brain function during the performance of cognitive and/or behavioral activities. What is more, the central dogma of the Neuroscience of today, i.e., brain plasticity as the morpho-functional substrate of memory and learning processes, was already proposed and documented with notable insights by Ramón y Cajal. From this background, I will try to discuss in this chapter which new functional and structural concepts have been introduced in contemporary Neuroscience and how we will be able to construct a set of basic principles underlying brain functions for the twenty-first century.},

Cajal became absolutely entranced by the fine structure of the nervous system this technique revealed, which led him to embark on one of the last truly epic endeavors in Modern History: the characterization of nervous cells, and of their organization to form the brain. Cajal remained in Spain throughout his scientific career, working for years alone. With international recognition, Cajal began recruiting brilliant students as collaborators. A handful of his pupils also made decisive discoveries that served to lay the foundations of modern Neuroscience. Cajal’s brother Pedro, Tello, Domingo Sánchez, Achúcarro, Lafora, Río-Hortega, de Castro and Lorente de Nó worked side by side with El Maestro. While Cajal himself pronounced some of the basic rules that have helped us to understand the nervous system (the neuron theory, the law of dynamic polarization of the neuron), as well as providing innumerable details about the histological organization of the different neural structures, it was Pío del Río-Hortega who identified two of the four main cell types in the {CNS} (oligodendrocytes and microglia), and Fernando de Castro who described the innervation of the blood vessels and identified the first chemoreceptors in the carotid body. Together, this group of scientists is known as the Spanish Neurological School, and if they had not existed, the History of Neuroscience would surely have been quite a different story; and proof that Cajal was a truly exceptional scientist but he was not an exception for Spanish Science.},

We demonstrate the power and flexibility of our approach on receptive fields, ion channels, and Hodgkin–Huxley models.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To describe the characteristics of activity bursts in the early preterm {EEG}, to assess inter-rater agreement of burst detection by visual inspection, and to determine the performance of an automated burst detector that uses non-linear energy operator ({NLEO}).
{METHODS}: {EEG} recordings from extremely preterm (n=12) and very preterm (n=6) infants were analysed. Three neurophysiologists independently marked bursts in the {EEG}, the characteristics of bursts were analyzed and inter-rater agreement determined. Unanimous detections were used as the gold standard in estimating the performance of an automated burst detector. In addition, some details of this automated detector were revised in an attempt to improve performance.
{RESULTS}: Overall, inter-rater agreement was 86\% for extremely preterm infants and 81\% for very preterm infants. In visual markings, bursts had variable lengths (approximately 1-10s) and increased amplitudes (and power) throughout the frequency spectrum. Accuracy of the original detection algorithm was 87\% and 79\% and accuracy of the revised algorithm 93\% and 87\% for extremely preterm and very preterm babies, respectively.
{CONCLUSION}: Visual detection of bursts from the early preterm {EEG} is comparable albeit not identical between raters. The original automated detector underestimates the amount of burst occurrence, but can be readily improved to yield results comparable to visual detection. Further clinical studies are warranted to assess the optimal descriptors of burst detection for monitoring and prognostication.
{SIGNIFICANCE}: Validation of a burst detector offers an evidence-based platform for further development of brain monitors in very preterm babies.},

We analyzed local field potential ({LFP}) and spiking from the prefrontal cortex ({PFC}) of monkeys performing a working memory task. There were brief bursts of narrow-band gamma oscillations (45-100 Hz), varied in time and frequency, accompanying encoding and re-activation of sensory information. They appeared at a minority of recording sites associated with spiking reflecting the to-be-remembered items. Beta oscillations (20-35 Hz) also occurred in brief, variable bursts but reflected a default state interrupted by encoding and decoding. Only activity of neurons reflecting encoding/decoding correlated with changes in gamma burst rate. Thus, gamma bursts could gate access to, and prevent sensory interference with, working memory. This supports the hypothesis that working memory is manifested by discrete oscillatory dynamics and spiking, not sustained activity.},

	abstract = {C. elegans has a highly developed chemosensory system that enables it to detect a wide variety of volatile (olfactory) and water-soluble (gustatory) cues associated with food, danger, or other animals. Much of its nervous system and more than 5\% of its genes are devoted to the recognition of environmental chemicals. Chemosensory cues can elicit chemotaxis, rapid avoidance, changes in overall motility, and entry into and exit from the alternative dauer developmental stage. These behaviors are regulated primarily by the amphid chemosensory organs, which contain eleven pairs of chemosensory neurons. Each amphid sensory neuron expresses a specific set of candidate receptor genes and detects a characteristic set of attractants, repellents, or pheromones. About 500–1000 different G protein-coupled receptors ({GPCRs}) are expressed in chemosensory neurons, and these may be supplemented by alternative sensory pathways as well. Downstream of the {GPCRs}, two signal transduction systems are prominent in chemosensation, one that uses {cGMP} as a second messenger to open {cGMP}-gated channels, and one that relies upon {TRPV} channels. These sensory pathways are modulated and fine-tuned by kinases and phosphatases. Chemosensory preferences can be modified by sensory adaptation, developmental history, and associative learning, allowing C. elegans to integrate context and experience into its behavior.},

The name is a blend of Greek and Latin (Caeno, recent; rhabditis, rod; elegans, nice). Two strains have historical importance. One strain, Bergerac, was collected from the soil in France by Victor Nigon of the Université de Lyon (Nigon 1949), and the other strain, Bristol, was isolated by L.N. Staniland (National Agricultural Advisory Service, London) from mushroom compost near Bristol, England (Nicholas et al. 1959). At high inoculum, C. elegans and its associated bacteria are reported to cause losses in mushroom yield and quality (Grewal 1991).},

We have cloned the C. elegans lin-4 locus by chromosomal walking and transformation rescue. We used the C. elegans clone to isolate the gene from three other Caenorhabditis species; all four Caenorhabditis clones functionally rescue the lin-4 null allele of C. elegans. Comparison of the lin-4 genomic sequence from these four species and site-directed mutagenesis of potential open reading frames indicated that lin-4 does not encode a protein. Two small lin-4 transcripts of approximately 22 and 61 nt were identified in C. elegans and found to contain sequences complementary to a repeated sequence element in the 3′ untranslated region ({UTR}) of lin-14 {mRNA}, suggesting that lin-4 regulates lin-14 translation via an antisense {RNA}-{RNA} interaction.},

More importantly, the “molecular actors” of the memory dialogue are well-conserved both across phylogenetic groups and learning paradigms, involving single- or multi-trials, aversion or reward, operant or classical conditioning. At the same time, this model could help to study how, where and when the memory dialog is impaired in stressful conditions and during aging and neurodegeneration in humans and thus offers new insights and targets in order to develop innovative therapies and technology for the treatment of a range of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders.},

An identified interneuron in the abdominal ganglion of Aplysia mediates both direct excitation and inhibition to an identified follower cell. At low firing rates the interneuron produces excitatory postsynaptic potentials; however at higher firing rates these gradually diminish in size and eventually invert to inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. Electrophysiological and pharmacological evidence indicates that the connection between these cells is monosynaptic, and that a single transmitter, acetylcholine, mediates both actions. These opposite synaptic responses appear to result from the transmitter's acting on two types of postsynaptic receptors having different thresholds for activation and different susceptibilities for desensitization.},

	abstract = {Cortical neuroscience is founded on studies of a very few model organisms, mainly rats, cats, and macaque monkeys. The concentration of effort on such a few species would be defensible if cortical organization were basically uniform across mammals, as is commonly believed. Although there is little reason to doubt that some features of cortical organization are indeed widespread among mammals, phyletic variation in cortical organization is far more extensive than has generally been appreciated or acknowledged. Rats, for example, differ from other mammals in the genetics and chemistry of their cortical neurons, in connectivity and areal organization, and in the functions of specific cortical regions. Likewise, macaque monkeys, although widely used as models of the human visual system, lack a number of features found in human visual cortex. Given the variability of cortical organization, how should neuroscientists approach the study of nonhuman species, and what can we reasonably expect to learn from them? First, by examining a wider range of species than are currently employed, and by using modern techniques of phyletic analysis, neuroscientists can more rigorously identify those features of cortical organization that are, in fact, widely shared among mammals or among particular mammalian subgroups. Second, by taking account of variations, neuroscientists can abstract more reliable and general principles of structure-function relationships in the nervous system. Finally, freed from the doctrine of basic uniformity, neuroscientists can pursue the study of human cortical specializations, and so advance our understanding of what distinguishes humans as a biological species.},

We have used the lucifer yellow photoinactivation technique to separate the connections made by the {PD} motor neurons from those made by the {AB} interneuron. 2. Photoinactivation of either the two {PD} neurons or the single {AB} neuron allowed us to separate the compound inhibitory postsynaptic potentials ({IPSPs}) in the lateral pyloric ({LP}) and pyloric ({PY}) motor neurons resulting from synchronous {PD} and {AB} activity into {AB}-evoked and {PD}-evoked components. These {IPSPs} have different time courses, reversal potentials, ion selectivities, and pharmacological properties. 3. Photoinactivation and membrane-potential manipulations indicated that a readily observable {IPSP} recorded in the {AB} neuron and correlated with action potentials in the {LP} neuron is actually an electrotonic potential due to an {LP}-evoked {IPSP} in the {PD} neurons. 4. Selective inactivation of either the two {PD} neurons or the {AB} neuron revealed that the {IPSP} recorded in the ventricular dilator ({VD}) motor neuron is due solely to {AB}-released transmitter. 5. The electrical coupling potentials measurable between the {AB}, {PD}, and {VD} neuron somata are due to direct electrical coupling between all of these neurons. 6. Circuit analysis and transmitter identification may be complicated by electrical coupling. We suggest that the presence of electrical coupling between nonidentical neurons may provide a new mechanism that allows changes in synaptic characteristics among neurons within a "hard-wired" circuit.},

Many important discoveries on axonal conduction, synaptic transmission, integrative neurobiology and behaviour have been made by investigations of these remarkable animals. Their advantages as model organisms for investigations of nervous systems include (a) the large diameter of neurons, glia and muscle cells of some invertebrates, thereby facilitating microelectrode recordings; (b) simple nervous systems with few neurons, enhancing the tractability of neuronal circuitry; and (c) well-defined behaviours, which lend themselves to physiological and genetic dissection. Genetic model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans have provided powerful genetic approaches to central questions concerning nervous system development, learning and memory and the cellular and molecular basis of behaviour. The process of attributing function to particular gene products has been greatly accelerated in recent years with access to entire genome sequences and the application of reverse genetic (e.g. {RNA} interference, {RNAi}) and other post-genome technologies (e.g. microarrays). Studies of many other invertebrates, notably the honeybee (Apis mellifera), a nudibranch mollusc (Aplysia californica), locusts, lobsters, crabs, annelids and jellyfish have all assisted in the development of major concepts in neuroscience. The future is equally bright with ease of access to genome-wide reverse genetic technologies, and the development of optical recordings using voltage and intracellular calcium sensors genetically targeted to selected individual and groups of neurons.},

Choosing a research topic, deciding what papers to write and where to publish them, sticking with a familiar area or going into something new—the payoff may be tenure or a job at a highly ranked university or a prestigious award or a bump in salary. The risk may be not getting any of that.At a time when science is seen as an engine of economic growth, Paula Stephan brings a keen understanding of the ongoing cost-benefit calculations made by individuals and institutions as they compete for resources and reputation. She shows how universities offload risks by increasing the percentage of non-tenure-track faculty, requiring tenured faculty to pay salaries from outside grants, and staffing labs with foreign workers on temporary visas. With funding tight, investigators pursue safe projects rather than less fundable ones with uncertain but potentially path-breaking outcomes. Career prospects in science are increasingly dismal for the young because of ever-lengthening apprenticeships, scarcity of permanent academic positions, and the difficulty of getting funded.Vivid, thorough, and bold, How Economics Shapes Science highlights the growing gap between the haves and have-nots—especially the vast imbalance between the biomedical sciences and physics/engineering—and offers a persuasive vision of a more productive, more creative research system that would lead and benefit the world.},

Determining the mechanisms that specify the formation and functional modulation of synaptic circuitry are critical to advancing both our fundamental understanding of the nervous system as well as the various neurodevelopmental, neurological, neuropsychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders that are met in clinical practice when these processes go awry. Defining the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying nervous system development, function, and pathology has proven challenging, due mainly to the complexity of the vertebrate brain. Simple model system approaches with invertebrate preparations, on the other hand, have played pivotal roles in elucidating the fundamental mechanisms underlying the formation and plasticity of individual synapses, and the contributions of individual neurons and their synaptic connections that underlie a variety of behaviors, and learning and memory. In this Review, we discuss the experimental utility of the invertebrate mollusc Lymnaea stagnalis, with a particular emphasis on in vitro cell culture, semi-intact and in vivo preparations, which enable molecular and electrophysiological identification of the cellular and molecular mechanisms governing the formation, plasticity, and specificity of individual synapses at a single-neuron or single-synapse resolution.},

	abstract = {Today, based on brain imaging analyses, we can consider the brilliant metaphor about event discreteness of the conscious process by William James (1890) to be an experimental fact. Such events compose sequences: linguistic, episodic memory, motor behavior, etc., whose dynamics are robust, reproducible, and sensitively react to incoming informational signals. The human mind is able to process, understand and predict time-dependent information about the environment and about ourselves, and generate corresponding commands to control behavior. Many experiments have indicated that the mind relies on sequential dynamics to carry out these tasks. Based on brain imaging experiments, we discuss here a set of key principles and their instantiation in nonlinear differential equations to form a dynamical theory of consciousness and creativity. General hierarchical models of consciousness and creativity include coupled low-dimensional equations that govern cooperative variables for several cognitive modalities: episodic (semantic) memory, working memory, attention, emotion, perception and their sequential interaction. In the phase spaces spanned by variables of these models, the joint transient dynamics of cognitive modalities is represented by coupled heteroclinic networks which share complex metastable states. The interaction of such states is responsible for the robustness of transient neural dynamics involved in the generation of thoughts and in the programming of behavior. In the framework of the analyzed dynamical models, we discuss the interaction of cognitive processes and the generation of new information in creativity.},

	abstract = {The present review discusses a well-established method for characterizing resting-state activity of the human brain using multichannel electroencephalography ({EEG}). This method involves the examination of electrical microstates in the brain, which are defined as successive short time periods during which the configuration of the scalp potential field remains semi-stable, suggesting quasi-simultaneity of activity among the nodes of large-scale networks. A few prototypic microstates, which occur in a repetitive sequence across time, can be reliably identified across participants. Researchers have proposed that these microstates represent the basic building blocks of the chain of spontaneous conscious mental processes, and that their occurrence and temporal dynamics determine the quality of mentation. Several studies have further demonstrated that disturbances of mental processes associated with neurological and psychiatric conditions manifest as changes in the temporal dynamics of specific microstates. Combined {EEG}-{fMRI} studies and {EEG} source imaging studies have indicated that {EEG} microstates are closely associated with resting-state networks as identified using {fMRI}. The scale-free properties of the time series of {EEG} microstates explain why similar networks can be observed at such different time scales. The present review will provide an overview of these {EEG} microstates, available methods for analysis, the functional interpretations of findings regarding these microstates, and their behavioral and clinical correlates.},

Such cognitive spatio-temporal processes can be represented by a set of sequential metastable dynamical states together with their associated transitions: The state is quasi-stationary close to one metastable state before a rapid transition to another state. Hence, we postulate that metastable states are the central players in cognitive information processing. Based on the analogy of quasiparticles as elementary units in physics, we introduce here the quantum of cognitive information dynamics, which we term “cognon”. A cognon, or dynamical unit of thought, is represented by a robust finite chain of metastable neural states. Cognons can be organized at multiple hierarchical levels and coordinate complex cognitive information representations. Since a cognon is an abstract conceptualization, we link this abstraction to brain sequential dynamics that can be measured using common modalities and argue that cognons and brain rhythms form binding spatiotemporal complexes to keep simultaneous dynamical information which relate the ‘what’, ‘where’ and ‘when’.},

Moreover, in the intact animal (as shown by electromyographic recordings) as well as in isolated preparation of the stomatogastric nervous system, pyloric and gastric networks do not produce only a stereotyped pattern, but a relatively large “repertoire” of outputs.

	abstract = {When the stomatogastric nervous system is dissected out of a lobster, pinned out in a dish and perfused with physiological saline, a highly ordered rhythmic pattern of bursts repeating at a rate of one to two cycles per second can be recorded from the pyloric motoneurons. The first time one sees these nerve recordings on an oscilloscope screen, or hears the pattern on an audio monitor, a sense of amazement is experienced: the pyloric pattern is spontaneously generated information. The neurons in that dish are an incredibly sophisticated biological “function generator”, and the immediate question is how does it all work? Could one ever hope to understand and explain the operation of this neural system at a mechanistic, cause-and-effect level? The purpose of this chapter is to attempt just such an explanation. First, as a basis for this discussion, the characteristics and variability of the pyloric burst pattern will be examined. In the following three sections, a review of pyloric mechanisms will be organized around three specific question: (1) Why do the pyloric cells fire in bursts of activity? (2) How are these bursts of activity coordinated to occur with the observed phase relationships? (3) What mechanisms determine the overall frequency of the motor pattern? Finally, we will integrate what we have learned about the circuitry, cellular and synaptic properties into a qualitative “gestalt” picture of pyloric pattern generation. A more quantitative description of pattern generation will be presented in Chapter 7.},

However, these results cannot be appreciated without a minimal knowledge of the anatomy of the neuromuscular systems in the foregut and cannot be put into a biological perspective if they do not explain the motor behavior. The goal of this first chapter is: (1) to describe the basic structure of the foregut and the anatomical organization of the muscles and neurons involved in its operation, and (2) to examine the possible range of motor behavior expressed by each region of the foregut in the intact animal.},

	abstract = {In the decade that followed the first modern demonstrations of neural central pattern generators, scientific milestones achieved by Hughes and Wiersma (1960) and D.M. Wilson (1961), many groups attempted to understand the mechanisms that generated particular motor patterns by analyzing the patterns themselves and by perturbing the nervous system in different ways. These were classic input-output analyses, whose main virtue was that they could be done and whose main weakness was that they could not distinguish between the host of alternative equivalent neural mechanisms that could generate the observed motor patterns. In that context, positive results from antidromic stimulation experiments (e.g., Mulloney 1970, Stein 1971) were exciting because they eliminated a class of alternative models. From the frustration that grew among students and scientists who tried to analyze neural mechanisms with the methods then available grew the idea that if the synaptic organization of the neurons involved could somehow be discovered, the mechanism that generated these enticing motor patterns could be explained and understood. D.M. Maynard’s (1972) reports of the properties of the {STG} in various crustaceans were exciting because here was a nontrivial motor pattern generated by neurons from which we could record more than impulses. Perhaps this ganglion generated behaviors that physiologists could understand.},

	abstract = {Motor coordination by the nervous system involves generating and coordinating muscle sequential activity. Such activity must be robust to produce effective motion that relies on patterned motor events ordered in a specific sequence and, at the same time, flexible in timing and duration to adapt to intrinsic and environmental circumstances. Motor neural circuits produce the signaling that muscles use for their sequential action. Even in rhythmic repetitive motion such as walking, breathing and chewing, variability in the timing of the events that build the sequence can be observed within the overall ordered rhythm of the motion. In this context, central pattern generators ({CPGs}) are key neural circuits to study the cycle-by-cycle balance between the robustness of the sequential order of neural events and the irregularity of the intracycle intervals that shape a rhythmic sequence. Recently, the presence of sequential dynamical invariants in the form of robust cycle-by-cycle relationships between specific sequence time intervals was unveiled in living {CPGs}. Variability of other sequence intervals remains unrelated and coexists with the presence of the invariants. Sequential dynamical invariants have been proposed to underlie the cycle-by-cycle {CPG} coordination. In this work, we used a minimal {CPG} circuit building block of two interacting inhibitory model neurons to assess the emergence of coordinated variability in sequential neural activity. We studied the conditions that produce sequential dynamical invariants in the circuit using intrinsically irregular neuron models and symmetric and asymmetric network topologies. We quantified the circuit irregularity and related it to the presence of invariants under different configurations. We found the conditions to propagate and sustain coordinated variability between time intervals, and thus our study illustrates the auto-organized constraint-based mechanisms for motor sequence coordination that shape sequential dynamical invariants. This is the first model study in which sequential dynamical invariants are observed considering only the intrinsic variability of {CPG} neurons without external stimuli. Finally, we discuss possible applications of this research in the context of autonomous robotics and artificial intelligence.},

However, {SNNs} have developed separately from artificial neural networks ({ANNs}), limiting the impact of deep learning advances for {SNNs}. Here, we present an alternative perspective of the spiking neuron that incorporates its neural dynamics into a recurrent {ANN} unit called a spiking neural unit ({SNU}). {SNUs} may operate as {SNNs}, using a step function activation, or as {ANNs}, using continuous activations. We demonstrate the advantages of {SNU} dynamics through simulations on multiple tasks and obtain accuracies comparable to, or better than, those of {ANNs}. The {SNU} concept enables an efficient implementation with in-memory acceleration for both training and inference. We experimentally demonstrate its efficacy for a music-prediction task in an in-memory-based {SNN} accelerator prototype using 52,800 phase-change memory devices. Our results open up an avenue for broad adoption of biologically inspired neural dynamics in challenging applications and acceleration with neuromorphic hardware.},

The Hodgkin-Huxley model established a framework in which to describe the structural and functional properties of ion channels, including the mechanisms of ion permeation, selectivity, and gating. At a cellular level, the model is used to understand the conditions that control both the rate and timing of action potentials, essential for neural encoding of information. Finally, the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism is central to computational neuroscience to understand both neuronal integration and circuit level information processing, and how these mechanisms might have evolved to minimize energy cost.},

	abstract = {Chaotic regimes in a mathematical model of pacemaker activity in the bursting neurons of a snail,Helix pomatia, have been investigated. The model includes a slow-wave generating mechanism, a spike-generating mechanism, an inward Ca current, intracellular Ca ions, [Ca2+]intheir fast buffering and uptake by intracellular Ca stores, and a [Ca2+]in-inhibited Ca current. Chemosensitive voltage-activated conductance,{gB}*, responsible for termination of the spike burst, and chemosensitive sodium conductance,{gNa}*, responsible for the depolarizing phase of the slow-wave, were used as control parameters. These conductances in intact snail bursting neuron are regulated by neuropeptides. Time courses of the membrane potential and [Ca2+]inwere employed to analyse different regimes in the model. Histograms of interspike intervals, autocorrelograms, spectral characteristics, one-dimensional return maps, phase plane trajectories, positive Lyapunov exponent and especially cascades of period-doubling bifurcations demonstrate that approaches to chaos were generated. The bifurcation diagram as a function {ofgB}*and the ([Ca2+]in-V) phase diagram of initial conditions reveal fractal features. It has been observed that a short-lasting depolarizing current or elevation of [Ca2+]inmay evoke transformation of chaotic activity into a regular bursting one. These kinds of transitions do not require any changes in the parameters of the model. The results demonstrate that chaotic regimes of neuronal activity modulated by neuropeptides may play a relevant role in information processing and storage at the level of a single neuron.},

To address this, we have developed Open Source Brain, a platform for sharing, viewing, analyzing, and simulating standardized models from different brain regions and species. Model structure and parameters can be automatically visualized and their dynamical properties explored through browser-based simulations. Infrastructure and tools for collaborative interaction, development, and testing are also provided. We demonstrate how existing components can be reused by constructing new models of inhibition-stabilized cortical networks that match recent experimental results.

For example, robust speech recognition is relatively easy for humans but exceptionally difficult for artificial speech recognition systems. In this paper, we propose that recognition can be simplified with an internal model of how sensory input is generated, when formulated in a Bayesian framework. We show that a plausible candidate for an internal or generative model is a hierarchy of ‘stable heteroclinic channels’. This model describes continuous dynamics in the environment as a hierarchy of sequences, where slower sequences cause faster sequences. Under this model, online recognition corresponds to the dynamic decoding of causal sequences, giving a representation of the environment with predictive power on several timescales. We illustrate the ensuing decoding or recognition scheme using synthetic sequences of syllables, where syllables are sequences of phonemes and phonemes are sequences of sound-wave modulations. By presenting anomalous stimuli, we find that the resulting recognition dynamics disclose inference at multiple time scales and are reminiscent of neuronal dynamics seen in the real brain.},

Temporal processing on this scale is required for simple sensory problems, such as interval, duration, and motion discrimination, as well as complex forms of sensory processing, such as speech recognition. Timing is also required for a wide range of motor tasks from eyelid conditioning to playing the piano. Here we review the behavioral, electrophysiological, and theoretical literature on the neural basis of temporal processing. These data suggest that temporal processing is likely to be distributed among different structures, rather than relying on a centralized timing area, as has been suggested in internal clock models. We also discuss whether temporal processing relies on specialized neural mechanisms, which perform temporal computations independent of spatial ones. We suggest that, given the intricate link between temporal and spatial information in most sensory and motor tasks, timing and spatial processing are intrinsic properties of neural function, and specialized timing mechanisms such as delay lines, oscillators, or a spectrum of different time constants are not required. Rather temporal processing may rely on state-dependent changes in network dynamics.},

	abstract = {The complex and melodic nature of many birds' songs has raised interest in potential parallels between avian vocal sequences and human speech. The similarities between birdsong and speech in production and learning are well established, but surprisingly little is known about how birds perceive song sequences. One popular laboratory songbird, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), has recently attracted attention as an avian model for human speech, in part because the male learns to produce the individual elements in its song motif in a fixed sequence. But psychoacoustic evidence shows that adult zebra finches are relatively insensitive to the sequential features of song syllables. Instead, zebra finches and other birds seem to be exquisitely sensitive to the acoustic details of individual syllables to a degree that is beyond human hearing capacity. Based on these findings, we present a finite-state model of zebra finch perception of song syllable sequences and discuss the rich informational capacity of their vocal system. Furthermore, we highlight the abilities of budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus), a parrot species, to hear sequential features better than zebra finches and suggest that neurophysiological investigations comparing these species could prove fruitful for uncovering neural mechanisms for auditory sequence perception in human speech.

	abstract = {Electromyographic recordings from the buccal muscles of Lymnaea during feeding has shown that there are 4 component phases in the feeding cycle. Cinephotography of feeding cycles has confirmed that these correspond to protraction, 2 phases of retraction, and an inactive phase. The 4 phases of muscle activity can also be related to the cycle of neural activity described previously (Benjamin \&amp; Rose, 1979). Thus types 6, 4 group, and type 8 cells are motoneurones involved in protraction and the two retraction phases, while the type 5 cell fires in the inactive period. The combination of physiological and anatomical approaches has led to the suggestion that the single and double input cells described by Benjamin \&amp; Rose (1979) are involved with the control of buccal and oesophageal activity respectively.},

	abstract = {1. A simple inexpensive method is described for culturing L. s. appressa in large numbers in relatively small space through an indefinite number of generations. This method involves rearing the snails in three to ten liters of aerated water in deep covered glass jars located in subdued natural light, with approximately two adult snails to each liter of water. The water used is deep well water rich in calcium and magnesium and alkaline in reaction. The jars are cleaned and the water changed weekly, or bimonthly at the longest, and in winter the cold water is warmed to the prior temperature of the aquarium before the snails are placed in it. A small quantity of fine sand, used in trituration of food by the snail gizzard, is furnished in the aquaria. Loose green head lettuce leaves are kept available in the aquaria most of the time; and weekly, wheat cereal cooked in milk and supplemented by a mixture of balanced salts is added. 2. Prehatching mortality by this method is negligible. Sexual maturity is reached in about three months and the average final length of snails reached is between fifty and fifty-five mm. The longest snail ever cultured attained a length of 62.5 mm. The maximum life span of the snail under these cultural conditions is fourteen months. 3. Observations on crawling and feeding, movements concerned with respiration, overcrowding, copulation, oviposition and egg production, gross embryology, hatching, exchange of water for air in the lung, desiccation, etc., are recorded. 4. Egg production was approximately doubled by the addition of cooked wheat cereal to the normal lettuce diet. Non-copulating snails, kept in solitary culture through their sexually mature existence, laid a greater number of eggs per snail than copulating snails living in a group. Snails kept in group culture started ovipositing sooner than in solitary culture. In individual snails the maximum length of egg masses per day increased sharply shortly after egg laying commenced, reached a peak somewhere in the middle of the egg laying period and then gradually tapered at the end. Oviposition in snails kept in solitary culture occurred in periods of variable duration alternating with rest periods.},

	abstract = {In recent years, brain research has indisputably entered a new epoch, driven by substantial methodological advances and digitally enabled data integration and modelling at multiple scales— from molecules to the whole brain. Major advances are emerging at the intersection of neuroscience with technology and computing. This new science of the brain combines high-quality research, data integration across multiple scales, a new culture of multidisciplinary large-scale collaboration and translation into applications. As pioneered in Europe’s Human Brain Project ({HBP}), a systematic approach will be essential for meeting the coming decade’s pressing medical and technological challenges. The aims of this paper are to: develop a concept for the coming decade of digital brain research, discuss this new concept with the research community at large, to identify points of convergence, and derive therefrom scientific common goals; provide a scientific framework for the current and future development of {EBRAINS}, a research infrastructure resulting from the {HBP}’s work; inform and engage stakeholders, funding organisations and research institutions regarding future digital brain research; identify and address the transformational potential of comprehensive brain models for artificial intelligence, including machine learning and deep learning; outline a collaborative approach that integrates reflection, dialogues and societal engagement on ethical and societal opportunities and challenges as part of future neuroscience research.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we suggest that cortical anatomy recapitulates the temporal hierarchy that is inherent in the dynamics of environmental states. Many aspects of brain function can be understood in terms of a hierarchy of temporal scales at which representations of the environment evolve. The lowest level of this hierarchy corresponds to fast fluctuations associated with sensory processing, whereas the highest levels encode slow contextual changes in the environment, under which faster representations unfold. First, we describe a mathematical model that exploits the temporal structure of fast sensory input to track the slower trajectories of their underlying causes. This model of sensory encoding or perceptual inference establishes a proof of concept that slowly changing neuronal states can encode the paths or trajectories of faster sensory states. We then review empirical evidence that suggests that a temporal hierarchy is recapitulated in the macroscopic organization of the cortex. This anatomic-temporal hierarchy provides a comprehensive framework for understanding cortical function: the specific time-scale that engages a cortical area can be inferred by its location along a rostro-caudal gradient, which reflects the anatomical distance from primary sensory areas. This is most evident in the prefrontal cortex, where complex functions can be explained as operations on representations of the environment that change slowly. The framework provides predictions about, and principled constraints on, cortical structure–function relationships, which can be tested by manipulating the time-scales of sensory input.},
