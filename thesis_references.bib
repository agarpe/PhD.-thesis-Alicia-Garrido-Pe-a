	abstract = {Speech and music have structured rhythms. Here we discuss a major acoustic correlate of spoken and musical rhythms, the slow (0.25–32 Hz) temporal modulations in sound intensity and compare the modulation properties of speech and music. We analyze these modulations using over 25 h of speech and over 39 h of recordings of Western music. We show that the speech modulation spectrum is highly consistent across 9 languages (including languages with typologically different rhythmic characteristics). A different, but similarly consistent modulation spectrum is observed for music, including classical music played by single instruments of different types, symphonic, jazz, and rock. The temporal modulations of speech and music show broad but well-separated peaks around 5 and 2 Hz, respectively. These acoustically dominant time scales may be intrinsic features of speech and music, a possibility which should be investigated using more culturally diverse samples in each domain. Distinct modulation timescales for speech and music could facilitate their perceptual analysis and its neural processing.},

	abstract = {Neuroimaging studies have shown that execution of a musical sequence on an instrument activates bilateral frontal opercular regions, in addition to bilateral sensorimotor and supplementary motor areas. During imagining activation of the same areas without primary sensorimotor areas was shown. We recorded EEG from 58 scalp positions to investigate the temporal sequence and the time course of activation of these areas while violin players prepared to execute, executed, prepared to imagine, or imagined a musical sequence on a violin. During the preparation for the sequence in three of seven musicians investigated the bilateral frontal opercular regions became active earlier than the motor areas and in one of them simultaneously with the motor areas. In two of the musicians a rather variable pattern of activation was observed. The frontal opercular regions were also strongly involved throughout the period of music execution or imagining. The supplementary motor area was involved in both preparation for the sequence and during execution and imagining of the sequence. The left primary sensorimotor area was involved in the preparation and termination of the musical sequence for both execution and imagining. The right sensorimotor area was strongly involved in the preparation for and during the execution of the sequence. We conclude that the bilateral frontal opercular regions are crucial in both preparation for and during music execution and imagining. They may have "mirror neurone" properties that underlie observation or imagining of one's own performance. The motor areas are differentially activated during the preparation and execution or imagining the sequence. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: A number of studies have been done on movement imagination of motor sequences with a single limb. However, brain oscillatory patterns induced by movement imagination of motor sequences involving multiple limbs have not been reported in recent years. The goal of the present study was to verify the feasibility of application of motor sequences involving multiple limbs to brain-computer interface (BCI) systems based on motor imagery (MI). The changes of EEG patterns and the inter-influence between movements associated with the imagination of motor sequences were also investigated. Methods: The experiment, where 12 healthy subjects participated, involved one motor sequence with a single limb and three kinds of motor sequences with two or three limbs. The activity involved mental simulation, imagining playing drums with two conditions (60 and 30 beats per minute for the first and second conditions, respectively). Results: Movement imagination of different limbs in the sequence contributed to time-variant event-related desynchronization (ERD) patterns within both mu and beta rhythms, which was more obvious for the second condition compared with the first condition. The ERD values of left/right hand imagery with prior hand imagery were significantly larger than those with prior foot imagery, while the phase locking values (PLVs) between central electrodes and the mesial frontocentral electrode of non-initial movement were significantly larger than those of the initial movement during imagination of motor sequences for both conditions. Classification results showed that the power spectral density (PSD) based method outperformed the multi-class common spatial patterns (multi-CSP) based method: The highest accuracies were 82.86 \% and 91.43 \%, and the mean values were 65 \% and 74.14 \% for the first and second conditions, respectively. Conclusions: This work implies that motor sequences involving multiple limbs can be utilized to build a multimodal classification paradigm in MI-based BCI systems, and that prior movement imagination can result in the changes of neural activities in motor areas during subsequent movement imagination in the process of limb switching.},

The EEG signals were acquired during sequences of MI of volleyball spike movement in kinesthetic and visual modalities and also at control condition. Thirty right-handed male subjects (18 to 40 years) were assigned to either an 'athlete' or a 'non-athlete' group, both containing 15 volunteers. Paired Wilcoxon tests (with α=0.05) indicates that sequential MI of complex tasks promotes cortical changes, mainly in the power vicinity of the alpha peak.

Recent work on vertebrates highlights the importance of neuromodulatory control pathways in enabling spinal cord and brain stem circuits to generate meaningful motor patterns. Because rhythmic motor patterns are easily quantified and studied, central pattern generators will provide important testing grounds for understanding the effects of numerous genetic mutations on behavior. Moreover, further understanding of the modulation of spinal cord circuitry used in rhythmic behaviors should facilitate the development of new treatments to enhance recovery after spinal cord damage.},

We introduce one-and-two dimensional phase portraits to illustrate the behaviors, thus reducing the study of dynamical mechanisms to planar geometrical properties. We examined whether other mechanisms besides the escape and release mechanisms might be needed for some cases of reciprocal inhibition, and show that, within the confines of a simple two-dimensional cell model, escape and release are sufficient for all cases. We divided the behaviors of a single cell into six different types and examined the joint behaviors arising from every combination of pairs of cells with behaviors drawn from these six types. For the case of two quiescent cells or two cells each having plateau potentials, bifurcation diagrams demonstrate the relations between synaptic threshold and synaptic strength necessary for oscillations by escape, oscillations by release, or network-generated plateau potentials. Thus we clarify the relationship between plateau potentials and oscillations in a cell. Using the two dimensional cell model we examine 1:N beating between cells and find that our simple model displays many of the essential dynamical properties displayed by more sophisticated models, some of which relate to thalamocortical spindling.},

Here we review important neural parallels between birdsong and speech. In both cases there are separate but continually interacting neural networks that underlie vocal production, sensorimotor learning, and auditory perception and memory. As in the case of human speech, neural activity related to birdsong learning is lateralized, and mirror neurons linking perception and performance may contribute to sensorimotor learning. In songbirds that are learning their songs, there is continual interaction between secondary auditory regions and sensorimotor regions, similar to the interaction between Wernicke's and Broca's areas in human infants acquiring speech and language. Taken together, song learning in birds and speech acquisition in humans may provide useful insights into the evolution and mechanisms of auditory-vocal learning.},

	abstract = {Central pattern generators (CPGs) are networks underlying rhythmic motor behaviours and they are dynamically regulated by neuronal elements that are extrinsic or intrinsic to the rhythmogenic circuit. In the feeding system of the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, the extrinsic slow oscillator (SO) interneuron controls the frequency of the feeding rhythm and the N3t (tonic) has a dual role; it is an intrinsic CPG interneuron, but it also suppresses CPG activity in the absence of food, acting as a decision-making element in the feeding circuit. The firing patterns of the SO and N3t neurons and their synaptic connections with the rest of the CPG are known, but how these regulate network function is not well understood. This was investigated by building a computer model of the feeding network based on a minimum number of cells (N1M, N2v and N3t) required to generate the three-phase motor rhythm together with the SO that was used to activate the system. The intrinsic properties of individual neurons were represented using two-compartment models containing currents of the Hodgkin-Huxley type. Manipulations of neuronal activity in the N3t and SO neurons in the model produced similar quantitative effects to food and electrical stimulation in the biological network indicating that the model is a useful tool for studying the dynamic properties of the feeding circuit. The model also predicted novel effects of electrical stimulation of two CPG interneurons (N1M and N2v). When tested experimentally, similar effects were found in the biological system providing further validation of our model. © The Authors (2007).},

	abstract = {The activity in identified motor units supplying the coxal levator and depressor muscles of the cockroach have been recorded in intact freely walking animals and in preparations after removal of all sensory input from leg receptors. 2. Reciprocal activity in levator and depressor motoneurones can be evoked, or occurs spontaneously, in the partially de-afferented preparations, thus indicating the existence of a central locomotory rhythm generator. 3. The reciprocal activity patterns recorded in the same motoneurones in intact freely moving animals are not identical to those recorded in partially de-afferented preparations. Thus, the production of normal rhythmic leg movements depends to some extent on sensory input from leg receptors, this input probably exerting tonic and phasic effects on the central rhythm generator. 4. An increase in the resistance to leg retraction during normal walking results in an increase in discharge rate of the levator and depressor motoneurones. This observation further demonstrates that rhythmic leg movements are not exclusively centrally con- trolled. The receptors responsible for this reflex effect are probably the trochanteral campaniform sensilla.},

	abstract = {One contribution of 16 to a discussion meeting issue 'Homology and convergence in nervous system evolution'. Comparisons of rhythmic movements and the central pattern generators (CPGs) that control them uncover principles about the evolution of behaviour and neural circuits. Over the course of evolutionary history, gradual evolution of behaviours and their neural circuitry within any lineage of animals has been a predominant occurrence. Small changes in gene regulation can lead to divergence of circuit organization and corresponding changes in behaviour. However, some behavioural divergence has resulted from large-scale rewiring of the neural network. Divergence of CPG circuits has also occurred without a corresponding change in behaviour. When analogous rhythmic behaviours have evolved independently, it has generally been with different neural mechanisms. Repeated evolution of particular rhythmic behaviours has occurred within some lineages due to parallel evolution or latent CPGs. Particular motor pattern generating mechanisms have also evolved independently in separate lineages. The evolution of CPGs and rhythmic behaviours shows that although most behaviours and neural circuits are highly conserved, the nature of the behaviour does not dictate the neural mechanism and that the presence of homologous neural components does not determine the behaviour. This suggests that although behaviour is generated by neural circuits, natural selection can act separately on these two levels of biological organization.},

In this study, we described the biophysical properties of an uncharacterized channel (U-type channel) and investigated the role of the channel in the rhythmic activity of a respiratory pacemaker neuron and the respiratory behaviour in adult freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis. Our results show that the channel conducts an inward leak current carried by Na+ (ILeak-Na). The ILeak-Na contributed to the resting membrane potential and was required for maintaining rhythmic action potential bursting activity of the identified pacemaker RPeD1 neurons. Partial knockdown of the U-type channel suppressed the aerial respiratory behaviour of the adult snail in vivo. These findings identified the Na+ leak conductance via the U-type channel, likely a NALCN-like channel, as one of the fundamental mechanisms regulating rhythm activity of pacemaker neurons and respiratory behaviour in adult animals. © 2011 Lu, Feng.

	abstract = {Interference-based forgetting occurs when new information acquired either before or after a learning event attenuates memory expression (proactive and retroactive interference, respectively). Multiple learning events often occur in rapid succession, leading to competition between consolidating memories. However, it is unknown what factors determine which memory is remembered or forgotten. Here, we challenge the snail, Lymnaea, to acquire two consecutive similar or different memories and identify learning-induced changes in neurons of its well-characterized motor circuits. We show that when new learning takes place during a stable period of the original memory, proactive interference only occurs if the two consolidating memories engage the same circuit mechanisms. If different circuits are used, both memories survive. However, any new learning during a labile period of consolidation promotes retroactive interference and the acquisition of the new memory. Therefore, the effect of interference depends both on the timing of new learning and the underlying neuronal mechanisms. Michael Crossley et al. use the snail Lymnaea to investigate the factors involved in determining which memories are remembered or forgotten when multiple learning events happen close together. They find that timing of events and whether the same neuronal mechanisms are used are key factors in determining whether interference will occur.},

How the nervous system uses these graded perceptual shifts to select between opposed motor patterns remains enigmatic. Here, we challenged food-deprived and satiated Lymnaea to choose between two mutually exclusive behaviors, ingestion or egestion, produced by the same feeding central pattern generator. Decoding the underlying neural circuit reveals that the activity of central dopaminergic interneurons defines hunger state and drives network reconfiguration, biasing satiated animals toward the rejection of stimuli deemed palatable by food-deprived ones. By blocking the action of these neurons, satiated animals can be reconfigured to exhibit a hungry animal phenotype. This centralized mechanism occurs in the complete absence of sensory retuning and generalizes across different sensory modalities, allowing food-deprived animals to increase their perception of food value in a stimulus-independent manner to maximize potential calorific intake.},

	abstract = {We study the processing of weak signals in a realistic neural medium of spiking neurons by means of the stochastic resonance mechanism. Assuming a Hebbian prescription for the maximal synaptic conductances that balances ex-citatory and inhibitory synaptic connections, and short-term synaptic plasticity processes affecting such conductances, the system exhibits dynamical well-defined phases. This includes a memory phase, in which population of neurons remain synchronized, an oscillatory phase characterized by jumps between different synchronized populations of neurons, and an asynchronous noisy phase. Increasing noise in the medium when a weak input stimulates each neuron, intriguing phenomena occurs near all the transition points between phases resulting in the emergence of stochastic multi-resonance. This is shown to be quite robust, as it occurs for different levels of synaptic plasticity, type and number of stored patterns , and network topologies. Such robustness suggests that the behaviour shown by the models here should also be observable in actual systems, as a recent psy-chophysical experiment seems also indicate.

In this paper, we use a closed-loop to control the rhythm of a CPG model based on this minimal network architecture. The closed-loop adapts the maximum conductance of the inhibition to achieve a regularized rhythm departing from an otherwise highly irregular spiking-bursting activity. Our results show that the closed-loop conductance control can rapidly find the best connectivity that leads to the regularization goal. We also discuss several external stimuli that lead to regularized CPG rhythms. We argue that the proposed closed-loop approach can be used to control CPG rhythms in a wide variety of applications in experimental and theoretical research.},

	abstract = {1. The role of the paired serotonergic cerebral giant cells (CGCs) in the feeding system of Lymnaea was examined by electrophysiological and pharmacological techniques. 2. The firing characteristics of the CGCs were recorded by fine wires attached to their cell bodies in freely moving intact snails (in vivo recording) and their 'physiological' rates of firing determined during feeding and other behaviors. 3. The mean CGC firing rates recorded in vivo varied between 1 and 20 spikes/min but never reached the average rates seen in the isolated CNS (60-120 spikes/min). Maximum rates of firing were seen during bouts of radula biting/rasping movements characteristic of the consummatory phase of feeding (15 ± 1.69 spikes/min, mean ± SE, range 7-20 spikes/min), with lower rates seen during locomotion (6.7 ± 0.75 spikes/min; range 5-9 spikes/min. The cells were rarely active when the animal was quiescent (1.45 ± 0.91 spikes/min; range 0-2 spikes/min). 4. In vivo recorded CGC firing was phase locked to the feeding movements of the animal, with spikes occurring just before the opening of the mouth, during the protraction phase of the feeding cycle. 5. Evoking firing rates on the CGCs in the isolated preparation similar to those seen in vivo during rasping movements (7-20 spikes/min) did not elicit a fictive feeding pattern in an inactive preparation. Neither did bath application of 10-9 M serotonin (5-HT; the transmitter of the CGCs). 6. To allow the modulatory role of the CGCs to be examined during patterned activity, the fictive feeding pattern was evoked in the isolated preparation by injecting depolarizing current into a modulatory neuron, the slow oscillator (SO). 7. The tonic firing activity of the CGCs was accurately maintained by current injection in the isolated preparation at rates equivalent to that occurring during feeding, locomotion, and quiescence in the intact snail. This was possible where the CGCs became silent after 1-2 h. Only when the CGCs activity was maintained at a rate ({\textasciitilde}15 spikes/min) similar to that occurring during rasping, was the SO able to drive a full, high-frequency fictive feeding pattern (15-20 cycles/min). At lower rates of CGC firing, the SO- driven rhythm was either of lower frequency or no rhythm occurred at all (CGCs silent). 8. In many isolated preparations (80\%) the CGCs remained active, and it was difficult to maintain specific levels of tonic activity by current injection. Here attempts to completely suppress CGC activity produced a lowering of fictive feeding rates but did not lead to the complete loss of the SO-driven pattern in the isolated preparation. Residual levels of CGC activity (axon spikes recorded) were still likely to be present. 9. Low concentrations of 5-HT (10-9-10-8 M) perfused over the buccal ganglia allowed the SO to drive a full, high-frequency fictive feeding rhythm in preparations where the CGCs were already silent or spike activity had been suppressed by hyperpolarizing current injection. 10. Perfusion of a variety of serotonergic antagonists across the buccal ganglia [7-methyltryptamine (7- MT) and cinanserin], when the CGCs were tonically active, slowed the rate of the SO-driven motor program to values comparable with mean frequencies seen in the CGC spike suppression experiments. 11. It is concluded that the CGCs and their transmitter 5-HT have a modulatory rather than a command function in the feeding system of Lymnaea. One type of modulation (gating function) requires a sufficient level of activity in the CGCs to 'enable' a second type of neuron (the SO) to drive a feeding rhythm. Above this gating threshold (7 spikes/min), within the 7-to 20-spikes/min firing range, the CGCs influence the frequency of the motor pattern, a second type of modulatory function.},

	doi = {10.1152/jn.1999.81.3.1330},
	abstract = {Dopamine activates two different receptors to produce variability in sign at an identified synapse. Chemical synaptic transmission was investigated at a central synapse between identified neurons in the freshwater snail, Lymnaea stagnalis. The presynaptic neuron was the dopaminergic cell, Right Pedal Dorsal one (RPeD1). The postsynaptic neuron was Visceral Dorsal four (VD4). These neurons are components of the respiratory central pattern generator. The synapse from RPeD1 to VD4 showed variability of sign, i.e., it was either inhibitory (monophasic and hyperpolarizing), biphasic (depolarizing followed by hyperpolarizing phases), or undetectable. Both the inhibitory and biphasic synapse were eliminated by low Ca 2+ /high Mg 2+ saline and maintained in high Ca 2+ /high Mg 2+ saline, indicating that these two types of connections were chemical and monosynaptic. The latency of the inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) in high Ca 2+ /high Mg 2+ saline was ∼43 ms, whereas the biphasic postsynaptic potential (BPSP) had ∼12-ms latency in either normal or high Ca 2+ /high Mg 2+ saline. For a given preparation, when dopamine was pressured applied to the soma of VD4, it always elicited the same response as the synaptic input from RPeD1. Thus, for a VD4 neuron receiving an IPSP from RPeD1, pressure application of dopamine to the soma of VD4 produced an inhibitory response similar to the IPSP. The reversal potentials of the IPSP and the inhibitory dopamine response were both approximately −90 mV. For a VD4 neuron with a biphasic input from RPeD1, pressure-applied dopamine produced a biphasic response similar to the BPSP. The reversal potentials of the depolarizing phase of the BPSP and the biphasic dopamine response were both approximately −44 mV, whereas the reversal potentials for the hyperpolarizing phases were both approximately −90 mV. The hyperpolarizing but not the depolarizing phase of the BPSP and the biphasic dopamine response was blocked by the d-2 dopaminergic antagonist (±) sulpiride. Previously, our laboratory demonstrated that both IPSP and the inhibitory dopamine response are blocked by (±) sulpiride. Conversely, the depolarizing phase of both the BPSP and the biphasic dopamine response was blocked by the Cl − channel antagonist picrotoxin. Finally, both phases of the BPSP and the biphasic dopamine response were desensitized by continuous bath application of dopamine. These results indicate that the biphasic RPeD1 → VD4 synapse is dopaminergic. Collectively, these data suggest that the variability in sign (inhibitory vs. biphasic) at the RPeD1 → VD4 synapse is due to activation of two different dopamine receptors on the postsynaptic neuron VD4. This demonstrates that two populations of receptors can produce two different forms of transmission, i.e., the inhibitory and biphasic forms of the single RPeD1 → VD4 synapse.},

	doi = {10.1152/jn.00203.2017},
	abstract = {A fundamental question in comparative neuroethology is the extent to which synaptic wiring determines behavior vs. the extent to which it is constrained by phylogeny. We investigated this by examining the connectivity and activity of homologous neurons in different species. Melibe leonina and Dendronotus iris (Mollusca, Gastropoda, Nudibranchia) have homologous neurons and exhibit homologous swimming behaviors consisting of alternating left-right (LR) whole body flexions. Yet, a homologous interneuron (Si1) differs between the two species in its participation in the swim motor pattern (SMP) and synaptic connectivity. In this study we examined Si1 homologs in two additional nudibranchs: Flabellina iodinea, which evolved LR swimming independently of Melibe and Dendronotus, and Tritonia diomedea, which swims with dorsal-ventral (DV) body flexions. In Flabellina, the contralateral Si1s exhibit alternating rhythmic bursting activity during the SMP and are members of the swim central pattern generator (CPG), as in Melibe. The Si1 homologs in Tritonia do not burst rhythmically during the DV SMP but are inhibited and receive bilaterally synchronous synaptic input. In both Flabellina and Tritonia, the Si1 homologs exhibit reciprocal inhibition, as in Melibe. However, in Flabellina the inhibition is polysynaptic, whereas in Tritonia it is monosynaptic, as in Melibe. In all species, the contralateral Si1s are electrically coupled. These results suggest that Flabellina and Melibe convergently evolved a swim CPG that contains Si1; however, they differ in monosynaptic connections. Connectivity is more similar between Tritonia and Melibe, which exhibit different swimming behaviors. Thus connectivity between homologous neurons varies independently of both behavior and phylogeny. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY This research shows that the synaptic connectivity between homologous neurons exhibits species-specific variations on a basic theme. The neurons vary in the extent of electrical coupling and reciprocal inhibition. They also exhibit different patterns of activity during rhythmic motor behaviors that are not predicted by their circuitry. The circuitry does not map onto the phylogeny in a predictable fashion either. Thus neither neuronal homology nor species behavior is predictive of neural circuit connectivity.},

Results of the application of three different labelling techniques on wholemount preparations were compared with each other and with the serotonin content of the ganglia, measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Serotonin immunocytochemistry resulted in the highest number of labelled neurons, but the more recently developed in vivo method of 5,6- or 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine-induced pigmentation also proved to be a reliable technique for the visualization of serotonin-containing cell bodies. In comparison with these two techniques, the glyoxylic acid fluorescence method appeared to be less sensitive. The distribution and number of serotonin-containing neurons and biochemically measured serotonin in specific ganglia showed a close correlation. By combining the results of the three labelling techniques, a detailed map of serotonin-containing neurons was constructed, and this was compared with maps of identified neurons prepared from earlier electrophysiological studies. Previously described serotonergic neurons were consistently found, as well as several new serotonin-containirig cell types in the cerebral, visceral and parietal ganglia. A network of serotonin-containing inter- and intraganglionic axon tracts, and thin serotonergic fibres in the perineurium were also demonstrated.

	abstract = {Synaptic dynamics differ markedly across connections and strongly regulate how action potentials are being communicated. To model the range of synaptic dynamics observed in experiments, we develop a flexible mathematical framework based on a linear-nonlinear operation. This model can capture various experimentally observed features of synaptic dynamics and different types of heteroskedasticity. Despite its conceptual simplicity, we show it is more adaptable than previous models. Combined with a standard maximum likelihood approach, synaptic dynamics can be accurately and efficiently characterized using naturalistic stimulation patterns. These results make explicit that synaptic processing bears algorithmic similarities with information processing in convolutional neural networks. Author summary Understanding how information is transmitted relies heavily on knowledge of the underlying regulatory synaptic dynamics. Existing computational models for capturing such dynamics are often either very complex or too restrictive. As a result, effectively capturing the different types of dynamics observed experimentally remains a challenging problem. Here, we propose a mathematically flexible linear-nonlinear model that is capable of efficiently characterizing synaptic dynamics. We demonstrate the ability of this model to capture different features of experimentally observed data.},

They are the most prominent representatives of a system of neurons expressing a gene that is similar to the gene expressed in R15 of Aplysia californica. Both neuronal systems are involved in the regulation of cardiorespiratory phenomena. In the present study the axonal branches of VD1 and RPD2 were mapped using immunocytochemical and tracer studies. To this end the α1-antiserum (directed to one of the VD1/RPD2 neuropeptides) was used in combination with Lucifer yellow (LY) and Ni-lys tracers. In whole mount preparations of the CNS, immunostained axons of VD1 and RPD2 were observed to run to the pleural, cerebral and pedal ganglia and in several nerves. Upon LY injection of VD1 thin axon branches were observed in the internal right parietal nerve. These run to the skin in the mantle area near the pneumostome and osphradium. The skin of the lips appeared to receive a similar innervation via the lip nerves. Thick LY filled axons of VD1 and RPD2 were observed in the intestinal nerve. They could be traced to the heart region. The pericardial branch of the intestinal nerve innervates the pericardium and heart (Ni-lys tracing). Immunocytochemically, using the α1-antiserum, it was demonstrated that this nerve branch carries the axons of VD1 and RPD2 to the venous side of the auricle, where they enter the pericardial cavity and ramify in the auricle (but not in the ventricle). Many immunopositive varicosities were observed on the auricular muscle fibers. Comparison of the stainings in the auricle with those obtained with antisera to the cardioactive neuropeptides FMRFamide and SCP showed no colocalization. The functional significance of the axonal distribution patterns of VD1 and RPD2 and the morphological and functional homology of the neurons to R15 of Aplysia are discussed. © 1991.},

Several CPGs localized in brainstem and spinal cord areas have been shown to underlie the expression of complex behaviors such as deglutition, mastication, respiration, defecation, micturition, ejaculation, and locomotion. Their pivotal roles have clearly been demonstrated although their organization and cellular properties remain incompletely characterized. In recent years, insightful findings about CPGs have been made mainly because (1) several complementary animal models were developed; (2) these models enabled a wide variety of techniques to be used and, hence, a plethora of characteristics to be discovered; and (3) organizations, functions, and cell properties across all models and species studied thus far were generally found to be well-preserved phylogenetically. This article aims at providing an overview for non-experts of the most important findings made on CPGs in in vivo animal models, in vitro preparations from invertebrate and vertebrate species as well as in primates. Data about CPG functions, adaptation, organization, and cellular properties will be summarized with a special attention paid to the network for locomotion given its advanced level of characterization compared with some of the other CPGs.

In part, this lack in understanding owes to the invasiveness of electrophysiological acquisition, the difficulty in their simultaneous recording over large cortical areas, and the absence of fully established methods for unbiased extraction of network information from these data. Here, we demonstrate a novel, data-driven approach to analyze spontaneous signal variations in electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings from nearly entire hemispheres of macaque monkeys. Based on both broadband analysis and analysis of specific frequency bands, the ECoG signals were found to co-vary in patterns that resembled the fMRI networks reported in previous studies. The extracted patterns were robust against changes in consciousness associated with sleep and anesthesia, despite profound changes in intrinsic characteristics of the raw signals, including their spectral signatures. These results suggest that the spatial organization of large-scale brain networks results from neural activity with a broadband spectral feature and is a core aspect of the brain's physiology that does not depend on the state of consciousness.},

	abstract = {Recent physiological studies of the neuronal processes underlying bimanual movements provide new tests for earlier functional models of bimanual coordination. The recently acquired data address three conceptual areas: the generalized motor program (GMP), intermanual crosstalk and dynamic systems models. To varying degrees, each of these concepts has aspects that can be reconciled with experimental evidence. The idea of a GMP is supported by the demonstration of abstract neuronal motor codes, e.g. bimanual-specific activity in motor cortex. The crosstalk model is consistent with the facts that hand-specific coding also exists and that interactions occur between the motor commands for each arm. Uncrossed efferent projections may underlie crosstalk on an executional level. Dynamic interhemispheric interactions through the corpus callosum may provide a high-level link at the parametric programming level, allowing flexible coupling and de-coupling. Flexible neuronal interactions could also underlie adaptive large-scale systems dynamics that can be formalized within the dynamic systems theory approach. The correspondence of identified neuronal processes with functions of abstract models encourages the development of realistic computational models that can predict bimanual behavior on the basis of neuronal activity.},

This review article addresses the psychological processes and brain mechanisms that enable such rhythmic interpersonal coordination. First, an overview is given of research on the cognitive-motor processes that enable individuals to represent joint action goals and to anticipate, attend and adapt to other’s actions in real time. Second, the neurophysiological mechanisms that underpin rhythmic interpersonal coordination are sought in studies of sensorimotor and cognitive processes that play a role in the representation and integration of selfand other-related actions within and between individuals’ brains. Finally, relationships between social–psychological factors and rhythmic interpersonal coordination are considered from two perspectives, one concerning how social-cognitive tendencies (e.g. empathy) affect coordination, and the other concerning how coordination affects interpersonal affiliation, trust and prosocial behaviour. Our review highlights musical ensemble performance as an ecologically valid yet readily controlled domain for investigating rhythm in joint action.},

In this study, we described the biophysical properties of an uncharacterized channel (U-type channel) and investigated the role of the channel in the rhythmic activity of a respiratory pacemaker neuron and the respiratory behaviour in adult freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis. Our results show that the channel conducts an inward leak current carried by Na+ (ILeak-Na). The ILeak-Na contributed to the resting membrane potential and was required for maintaining rhythmic action potential bursting activity of the identified pacemaker RPeD1 neurons. Partial knockdown of the U-type channel suppressed the aerial respiratory behaviour of the adult snail in vivo. These findings identified the Na+ leak conductance via the U-type channel, likely a NALCN-like channel, as one of the fundamental mechanisms regulating rhythm activity of pacemaker neurons and respiratory behaviour in adult animals. © 2011 Lu, Feng.

	abstract = {Near-infrared laser provides a novel nerve stimulation modality to regulate the cell functions. Understanding its physiological effect is a prerequisite for clinic laser therapy applications. Here, the whole-cell sodium (Na) channel kinetics of neuron cell was employed to determine the temporal roles of infrared laser. The Na currents were elicited by electrical pulses that were synchronized at the rising and falling edges of the 980 nm laser pulses, respectively, to investigate the different infrared effect on cell functions. The time constants of activation (τ m) and inactivation (τ h) kinetics were extracted from fitting of the Na current (m3h) according to the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model. By comparing the time constants without and with the laser irradiation, we obtained that laser pulses changed the Na current kinetics by accelerating τ h-phase and slowing down τ m-phase at the beginning of the laser pulse, whereas both phases were accelerated at the end of the pulse. After relating the ratios of the time constants to the temperature characteristics of Na channel by Q 10, we found that the accelerating in Na current kinetics could be related to the average temperature of extracellular solution in the corresponding time span by choosing Q 10 = 2.6. The results of this study demonstrated that there was a positive correlation between the acceleration of the Na current kinetics and increases in temperature of the extracellular solution. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

	abstract = {Previously (Syed et al. 1991) we described the ventilatory behavior of the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis and identified motor neurons that innervate various muscles involved in this behavior. In the present study we describe an interneuronal network that controls ventilatory behavior in Lymnaea. An identified interneuron, termed the input 3 interneuron (Ip.3.I), was found to be involved in the opening movement of the pneumostome (expiration), whereas another identified interneuron known as visceral dorsal 4 (V.D.4) caused its closure (inspiration). These cells have reciprocal inhibitory connections with each other, which accounts for their opposing effects on common follower motor neurons. In isolated brain preparations a third identified interneuron, right pedal dorsal 1 (R.Pe.D.1) initiated the respiratory cycle by the excitation of Ip.3.I. Whereas Ip.3.I in turn excited R.Pe.D.1, the connections between R.Pe.D.1 and V.D.4 were mutually inhibitory. Both Ip.3.I and V.D.4 were active during spontaneously occurring respiratory behavior as recorded from semi-intact preparations, and selective hyperpolarization of V.D.4 during such spontaneous activity disrupted the respiratory behavior. Regarding peripheral feedback, the mechanical stimulation of the pneumostome during its opening movements not only caused closure but also inhibited Ip.3.I in the middle of its discharge. Ip.3.I and V.D.4 were also found to be multifunctional, inhibiting both locomotor and whole body withdrawal neural networks. We conclude from these results that the rhythmic patterned activity underlying respiratory behavior in Lymnaea is generated centrally, and that the network described here therefore comprises a central pattern generator. © 1991, Springer-Verlag.

In this paper we show that this concept can be easily generalized to build other kinds of closed-loop protocols beyond (or in addition to) electrical stimulation and recording in neurophysiology and behavioral studies for neuroethology. In particular, we illustrate three different examples of goal-driven real-time closed-loop interactions with drug microinjectors, mechanical devices and video event driven stimulation. Modern activity-dependent stimulation protocols can be used to reveal dynamics (otherwise hidden under traditional stimulation techniques), achieve control of natural and pathological states, induce learning, bridge between disparate levels of analysis and for a further automation of experiments. We argue that closed-loop interaction calls for novel real time analysis, prediction and control tools and a new perspective for designing stimulus-response experiments, which can have a large impact in neuroscience research. ©2012 Chamorro et al.},

Cajal became absolutely entranced by the fine structure of the nervous system this technique revealed, which led him to embark on one of the last truly epic endeavors in Modern History: the characterization of nervous cells, and of their organization to form the brain. Cajal remained in Spain throughout his scientific career, working for years alone. With international recognition, Cajal began recruiting brilliant students as collaborators. A handful of his pupils also made decisive discoveries that served to lay the foundations of modern Neuroscience. Cajal’s brother Pedro, Tello, Domingo Sánchez, Achúcarro, Lafora, Río-Hortega, de Castro and Lorente de Nó worked side by side with El Maestro. While Cajal himself pronounced some of the basic rules that have helped us to understand the nervous system (the neuron theory, the law of dynamic polarization of the neuron), as well as providing innumerable details about the histological organization of the different neural structures, it was Pío del Río-Hortega who identified two of the four main cell types in the CNS (oligodendrocytes and microglia), and Fernando de Castro who described the innervation of the blood vessels and identified the first chemoreceptors in the carotid body. Together, this group of scientists is known as the Spanish Neurological School, and if they had not existed, the History of Neuroscience would surely have been quite a different story; and proof that Cajal was a truly exceptional scientist but he was not an exception for Spanish Science.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristics of activity bursts in the early preterm EEG, to assess inter-rater agreement of burst detection by visual inspection, and to determine the performance of an automated burst detector that uses non-linear energy operator (NLEO).
METHODS: EEG recordings from extremely preterm (n=12) and very preterm (n=6) infants were analysed. Three neurophysiologists independently marked bursts in the EEG, the characteristics of bursts were analyzed and inter-rater agreement determined. Unanimous detections were used as the gold standard in estimating the performance of an automated burst detector. In addition, some details of this automated detector were revised in an attempt to improve performance.
RESULTS: Overall, inter-rater agreement was 86\% for extremely preterm infants and 81\% for very preterm infants. In visual markings, bursts had variable lengths (approximately 1-10s) and increased amplitudes (and power) throughout the frequency spectrum. Accuracy of the original detection algorithm was 87\% and 79\% and accuracy of the revised algorithm 93\% and 87\% for extremely preterm and very preterm babies, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Visual detection of bursts from the early preterm EEG is comparable albeit not identical between raters. The original automated detector underestimates the amount of burst occurrence, but can be readily improved to yield results comparable to visual detection. Further clinical studies are warranted to assess the optimal descriptors of burst detection for monitoring and prognostication.
SIGNIFICANCE: Validation of a burst detector offers an evidence-based platform for further development of brain monitors in very preterm babies.},

We analyzed local field potential (LFP) and spiking from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of monkeys performing a working memory task. There were brief bursts of narrow-band gamma oscillations (45-100 Hz), varied in time and frequency, accompanying encoding and re-activation of sensory information. They appeared at a minority of recording sites associated with spiking reflecting the to-be-remembered items. Beta oscillations (20-35 Hz) also occurred in brief, variable bursts but reflected a default state interrupted by encoding and decoding. Only activity of neurons reflecting encoding/decoding correlated with changes in gamma burst rate. Thus, gamma bursts could gate access to, and prevent sensory interference with, working memory. This supports the hypothesis that working memory is manifested by discrete oscillatory dynamics and spiking, not sustained activity.},

	abstract = {Invertebrates have been deployed very successfully in experimental studies of the nervous system and neuromuscular junctions. Many important discoveries on axonal conduction, synaptic transmission, integrative neurobiology and behaviour have been made by investigations of these remarkable animals. Their advantages as model organisms for investigations of nervous systems include (a) the large diameter of neurons, glia and muscle cells of some invertebrates, thereby facilitating microelectrode recordings; (b) simple nervous systems with few neurons, enhancing the tractability of neuronal circuitry; and (c) well-defined behaviours, which lend themselves to physiological and genetic dissection. Genetic model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans have provided powerful genetic approaches to central questions concerning nervous system development, learning and memory and the cellular and molecular basis of behaviour. The process of attributing function to particular gene products has been greatly accelerated in recent years with access to entire genome sequences and the application of reverse genetic (e.g. RNA interference, RNAi) and other post-genome technologies (e.g. microarrays). Studies of many other invertebrates, notably the honeybee (Apis mellifera), a nudibranch mollusc (Aplysia californica), locusts, lobsters, crabs, annelids and jellyfish have all assisted in the development of major concepts in neuroscience. The future is equally bright with ease of access to genome-wide reverse genetic technologies, and the development of optical recordings using voltage and intracellular calcium sensors genetically targeted to selected individual and groups of neurons.},

	abstract = {1. The pyloric dilator (PD) and anterior burster (AB) neurons in the pyloric system of the lobster stomatogastric ganglion are electrically coupled and synchronously active. We have used the lucifer yellow photoinactivation technique to separate the connections made by the PD motor neurons from those made by the AB interneuron. 2. Photoinactivation of either the two PD neurons or the single AB neuron allowed us to separate the compound inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in the lateral pyloric (LP) and pyloric (PY) motor neurons resulting from synchronous PD and AB activity into AB-evoked and PD-evoked components. These IPSPs have different time courses, reversal potentials, ion selectivities, and pharmacological properties. 3. Photoinactivation and membrane-potential manipulations indicated that a readily observable IPSP recorded in the AB neuron and correlated with action potentials in the LP neuron is actually an electrotonic potential due to an LP-evoked IPSP in the PD neurons. 4. Selective inactivation of either the two PD neurons or the AB neuron revealed that the IPSP recorded in the ventricular dilator (VD) motor neuron is due solely to AB-released transmitter. 5. The electrical coupling potentials measurable between the AB, PD, and VD neuron somata are due to direct electrical coupling between all of these neurons. 6. Circuit analysis and transmitter identification may be complicated by electrical coupling. We suggest that the presence of electrical coupling between nonidentical neurons may provide a new mechanism that allows changes in synaptic characteristics among neurons within a "hard-wired" circuit.},

	abstract = {Cortical neuroscience is founded on studies of a very few model organisms, mainly rats, cats, and macaque monkeys. The concentration of effort on such a few species would be defensible if cortical organization were basically uniform across mammals, as is commonly believed. Although there is little reason to doubt that some features of cortical organization are indeed widespread among mammals, phyletic variation in cortical organization is far more extensive than has generally been appreciated or acknowledged. Rats, for example, differ from other mammals in the genetics and chemistry of their cortical neurons, in connectivity and areal organization, and in the functions of specific cortical regions. Likewise, macaque monkeys, although widely used as models of the human visual system, lack a number of features found in human visual cortex. Given the variability of cortical organization, how should neuroscientists approach the study of nonhuman species, and what can we reasonably expect to learn from them? First, by examining a wider range of species than are currently employed, and by using modern techniques of phyletic analysis, neuroscientists can more rigorously identify those features of cortical organization that are, in fact, widely shared among mammals or among particular mammalian subgroups. Second, by taking account of variations, neuroscientists can abstract more reliable and general principles of structure-function relationships in the nervous system. Finally, freed from the doctrine of basic uniformity, neuroscientists can pursue the study of human cortical specializations, and so advance our understanding of what distinguishes humans as a biological species.},

An identified interneuron in the abdominal ganglion of Aplysia mediates both direct excitation and inhibition to an identified follower cell. At low firing rates the interneuron produces excitatory postsynaptic potentials; however at higher firing rates these gradually diminish in size and eventually invert to inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. Electrophysiological and pharmacological evidence indicates that the connection between these cells is monosynaptic, and that a single transmitter, acetylcholine, mediates both actions. These opposite synaptic responses appear to result from the transmitter's acting on two types of postsynaptic receptors having different thresholds for activation and different susceptibilities for desensitization.},

More importantly, the “molecular actors” of the memory dialogue are well-conserved both across phylogenetic groups and learning paradigms, involving single- or multi-trials, aversion or reward, operant or classical conditioning. At the same time, this model could help to study how, where and when the memory dialog is impaired in stressful conditions and during aging and neurodegeneration in humans and thus offers new insights and targets in order to develop innovative therapies and technology for the treatment of a range of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders.},

We used the C. elegans clone to isolate the gene from three other Caenorhabditis species; all four Caenorhabditis clones functionally rescue the lin-4 null allele of C. elegans. Comparison of the lin-4 genomic sequence from these four species and site-directed mutagenesis of potential open reading frames indicated that lin-4 does not encode a protein. Two small lin-4 transcripts of approximately 22 and 61 nt were identified in C. elegans and found to contain sequences complementary to a repeated sequence element in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of lin-14 mRNA, suggesting that lin-4 regulates lin-14 translation via an antisense RNA-RNA interaction.},

Much of its nervous system and more than 5\% of its genes are devoted to the recognition of environmental chemicals. Chemosensory cues can elicit chemotaxis, rapid avoidance, changes in overall motility, and entry into and exit from the alternative dauer developmental stage. These behaviors are regulated primarily by the amphid chemosensory organs, which contain eleven pairs of chemosensory neurons. Each amphid sensory neuron expresses a specific set of candidate receptor genes and detects a characteristic set of attractants, repellents, or pheromones. About 500–1000 different G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are expressed in chemosensory neurons, and these may be supplemented by alternative sensory pathways as well. Downstream of the GPCRs, two signal transduction systems are prominent in chemosensation, one that uses cGMP as a second messenger to open cGMP-gated channels, and one that relies upon TRPV channels. These sensory pathways are modulated and fine-tuned by kinases and phosphatases. Chemosensory preferences can be modified by sensory adaptation, developmental history, and associative learning, allowing C. elegans to integrate context and experience into its behavior.},

The risk may be not getting any of that.At a time when science is seen as an engine of economic growth, Paula Stephan brings a keen understanding of the ongoing cost-benefit calculations made by individuals and institutions as they compete for resources and reputation. She shows how universities offload risks by increasing the percentage of non-tenure-track faculty, requiring tenured faculty to pay salaries from outside grants, and staffing labs with foreign workers on temporary visas. With funding tight, investigators pursue safe projects rather than less fundable ones with uncertain but potentially path-breaking outcomes. Career prospects in science are increasingly dismal for the young because of ever-lengthening apprenticeships, scarcity of permanent academic positions, and the difficulty of getting funded.Vivid, thorough, and bold, How Economics Shapes Science highlights the growing gap between the haves and have-nots—especially the vast imbalance between the biomedical sciences and physics/engineering—and offers a persuasive vision of a more productive, more creative research system that would lead and benefit the world.},

	abstract = {All functions of the nervous system are contingent upon the precise organization of neuronal connections that are initially patterned during development, and then continually modified throughout life. Determining the mechanisms that specify the formation and functional modulation of synaptic circuitry are critical to advancing both our fundamental understanding of the nervous system as well as the various neurodevelopmental, neurological, neuropsychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders that are met in clinical practice when these processes go awry. Defining the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying nervous system development, function, and pathology has proven challenging, due mainly to the complexity of the vertebrate brain. Simple model system approaches with invertebrate preparations, on the other hand, have played pivotal roles in elucidating the fundamental mechanisms underlying the formation and plasticity of individual synapses, and the contributions of individual neurons and their synaptic connections that underlie a variety of behaviors, and learning and memory. In this Review, we discuss the experimental utility of the invertebrate mollusc Lymnaea stagnalis, with a particular emphasis on in vitro cell culture, semi-intact and in vivo preparations, which enable molecular and electrophysiological identification of the cellular and molecular mechanisms governing the formation, plasticity, and specificity of individual synapses at a single-neuron or single-synapse resolution.},

Species range from terrestrial invertebrates such as nematodes and insects to freshwater and marine life including planarians, crustaceans, molluscs, and many others. The most often used models are the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the minuscule nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Topics in this article are categorized by biologic system, process, or disease with discussion of associated invertebrate models. Sections on bioactive products discovered from invertebrates follow the models section, and the article concludes with uses of invertebrates in teaching.

Such cognitive spatio-temporal processes can be represented by a set of sequential metastable dynamical states together with their associated transitions: The state is quasi-stationary close to one metastable state before a rapid transition to another state. Hence, we postulate that metastable states are the central players in cognitive information processing. Based on the analogy of quasiparticles as elementary units in physics, we introduce here the quantum of cognitive information dynamics, which we term “cognon”. A cognon, or dynamical unit of thought, is represented by a robust finite chain of metastable neural states. Cognons can be organized at multiple hierarchical levels and coordinate complex cognitive information representations. Since a cognon is an abstract conceptualization, we link this abstraction to brain sequential dynamics that can be measured using common modalities and argue that cognons and brain rhythms form binding spatiotemporal complexes to keep simultaneous dynamical information which relate the ‘what’, ‘where’ and ‘when’.},

This method involves the examination of electrical microstates in the brain, which are defined as successive short time periods during which the configuration of the scalp potential field remains semi-stable, suggesting quasi-simultaneity of activity among the nodes of large-scale networks. A few prototypic microstates, which occur in a repetitive sequence across time, can be reliably identified across participants. Researchers have proposed that these microstates represent the basic building blocks of the chain of spontaneous conscious mental processes, and that their occurrence and temporal dynamics determine the quality of mentation. Several studies have further demonstrated that disturbances of mental processes associated with neurological and psychiatric conditions manifest as changes in the temporal dynamics of specific microstates. Combined EEG-fMRI studies and EEG source imaging studies have indicated that EEG microstates are closely associated with resting-state networks as identified using fMRI. The scale-free properties of the time series of EEG microstates explain why similar networks can be observed at such different time scales. The present review will provide an overview of these EEG microstates, available methods for analysis, the functional interpretations of findings regarding these microstates, and their behavioral and clinical correlates.},

	abstract = {Today, based on brain imaging analyses, we can consider the brilliant metaphor about event discreteness of the conscious process by William James (1890) to be an experimental fact. Such events compose sequences: linguistic, episodic memory, motor behavior, etc., whose dynamics are robust, reproducible, and sensitively react to incoming informational signals. The human mind is able to process, understand and predict time-dependent information about the environment and about ourselves, and generate corresponding commands to control behavior. Many experiments have indicated that the mind relies on sequential dynamics to carry out these tasks. Based on brain imaging experiments, we discuss here a set of key principles and their instantiation in nonlinear differential equations to form a dynamical theory of consciousness and creativity. General hierarchical models of consciousness and creativity include coupled low-dimensional equations that govern cooperative variables for several cognitive modalities: episodic (semantic) memory, working memory, attention, emotion, perception and their sequential interaction. In the phase spaces spanned by variables of these models, the joint transient dynamics of cognitive modalities is represented by coupled heteroclinic networks which share complex metastable states. The interaction of such states is responsible for the robustness of transient neural dynamics involved in the generation of thoughts and in the programming of behavior. In the framework of the analyzed dynamical models, we discuss the interaction of cognitive processes and the generation of new information in creativity.},

	abstract = {Motor coordination by the nervous system involves generating and coordinating muscle sequential activity. Such activity must be robust to produce effective motion that relies on patterned motor events ordered in a specific sequence and, at the same time, flexible in timing and duration to adapt to intrinsic and environmental circumstances. Motor neural circuits produce the signaling that muscles use for their sequential action. Even in rhythmic repetitive motion such as walking, breathing and chewing, variability in the timing of the events that build the sequence can be observed within the overall ordered rhythm of the motion. In this context, central pattern generators (CPGs) are key neural circuits to study the cycle-by-cycle balance between the robustness of the sequential order of neural events and the irregularity of the intracycle intervals that shape a rhythmic sequence. Recently, the presence of sequential dynamical invariants in the form of robust cycle-by-cycle relationships between specific sequence time intervals was unveiled in living CPGs. Variability of other sequence intervals remains unrelated and coexists with the presence of the invariants. Sequential dynamical invariants have been proposed to underlie the cycle-by-cycle CPG coordination. In this work, we used a minimal CPG circuit building block of two interacting inhibitory model neurons to assess the emergence of coordinated variability in sequential neural activity. We studied the conditions that produce sequential dynamical invariants in the circuit using intrinsically irregular neuron models and symmetric and asymmetric network topologies. We quantified the circuit irregularity and related it to the presence of invariants under different configurations. We found the conditions to propagate and sustain coordinated variability between time intervals, and thus our study illustrates the auto-organized constraint-based mechanisms for motor sequence coordination that shape sequential dynamical invariants. This is the first model study in which sequential dynamical invariants are observed considering only the intrinsic variability of CPG neurons without external stimuli. Finally, we discuss possible applications of this research in the context of autonomous robotics and artificial intelligence.},

	abstract = {In the decade that followed the first modern demonstrations of neural central pattern generators, scientific milestones achieved by Hughes and Wiersma (1960) and D.M. Wilson (1961), many groups attempted to understand the mechanisms that generated particular motor patterns by analyzing the patterns themselves and by perturbing the nervous system in different ways. These were classic input-output analyses, whose main virtue was that they could be done and whose main weakness was that they could not distinguish between the host of alternative equivalent neural mechanisms that could generate the observed motor patterns. In that context, positive results from antidromic stimulation experiments (e.g., Mulloney 1970, Stein 1971) were exciting because they eliminated a class of alternative models. From the frustration that grew among students and scientists who tried to analyze neural mechanisms with the methods then available grew the idea that if the synaptic organization of the neurons involved could somehow be discovered, the mechanism that generated these enticing motor patterns could be explained and understood. D.M. Maynard’s (1972) reports of the properties of the STG in various crustaceans were exciting because here was a nontrivial motor pattern generated by neurons from which we could record more than impulses. Perhaps this ganglion generated behaviors that physiologists could understand.},

However, these results cannot be appreciated without a minimal knowledge of the anatomy of the neuromuscular systems in the foregut and cannot be put into a biological perspective if they do not explain the motor behavior. The goal of this first chapter is: (1) to describe the basic structure of the foregut and the anatomical organization of the muscles and neurons involved in its operation, and (2) to examine the possible range of motor behavior expressed by each region of the foregut in the intact animal.},

Just as the most sophisticated engine needs gas to function, the pyloric and gastric CPGs require extrinsic inputs in order to operate and produce a rhythmic output. Moreover, in the intact animal (as shown by electromyographic recordings) as well as in isolated preparation of the stomatogastric nervous system, pyloric and gastric networks do not produce only a stereotyped pattern, but a relatively large “repertoire” of outputs. It is also the activity of extrinsic inputs projecting onto the stomatogastric CPGs that determines such a flexibility of expression.},

	abstract = {When the stomatogastric nervous system is dissected out of a lobster, pinned out in a dish and perfused with physiological saline, a highly ordered rhythmic pattern of bursts repeating at a rate of one to two cycles per second can be recorded from the pyloric motoneurons. The first time one sees these nerve recordings on an oscilloscope screen, or hears the pattern on an audio monitor, a sense of amazement is experienced: the pyloric pattern is spontaneously generated information. The neurons in that dish are an incredibly sophisticated biological “function generator”, and the immediate question is how does it all work? Could one ever hope to understand and explain the operation of this neural system at a mechanistic, cause-and-effect level? The purpose of this chapter is to attempt just such an explanation. First, as a basis for this discussion, the characteristics and variability of the pyloric burst pattern will be examined. In the following three sections, a review of pyloric mechanisms will be organized around three specific question: (1) Why do the pyloric cells fire in bursts of activity? (2) How are these bursts of activity coordinated to occur with the observed phase relationships? (3) What mechanisms determine the overall frequency of the motor pattern? Finally, we will integrate what we have learned about the circuitry, cellular and synaptic properties into a qualitative “gestalt” picture of pyloric pattern generation. A more quantitative description of pattern generation will be presented in Chapter 7.},

With this in mind, it is easy to understand why the study of this system has contributed enormously to the emergence and improvement of our basic concepts concerning cellular, synaptic and circuit mechanisms in general.},

The Hodgkin-Huxley model established a framework in which to describe the structural and functional properties of ion channels, including the mechanisms of ion permeation, selectivity, and gating. At a cellular level, the model is used to understand the conditions that control both the rate and timing of action potentials, essential for neural encoding of information. Finally, the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism is central to computational neuroscience to understand both neuronal integration and circuit level information processing, and how these mechanisms might have evolved to minimize energy cost.},

However, SNNs have developed separately from artificial neural networks (ANNs), limiting the impact of deep learning advances for SNNs. Here, we present an alternative perspective of the spiking neuron that incorporates its neural dynamics into a recurrent ANN unit called a spiking neural unit (SNU). SNUs may operate as SNNs, using a step function activation, or as ANNs, using continuous activations. We demonstrate the advantages of SNU dynamics through simulations on multiple tasks and obtain accuracies comparable to, or better than, those of ANNs. The SNU concept enables an efficient implementation with in-memory acceleration for both training and inference. We experimentally demonstrate its efficacy for a music-prediction task in an in-memory-based SNN accelerator prototype using 52,800 phase-change memory devices. Our results open up an avenue for broad adoption of biologically inspired neural dynamics in challenging applications and acceleration with neuromorphic hardware.},

The model includes a slow-wave generating mechanism, a spike-generating mechanism, an inward Ca current, intracellular Ca ions, [Ca2+]intheir fast buffering and uptake by intracellular Ca stores, and a [Ca2+]in-inhibited Ca current. Chemosensitive voltage-activated conductance,gB*, responsible for termination of the spike burst, and chemosensitive sodium conductance,gNa*, responsible for the depolarizing phase of the slow-wave, were used as control parameters. These conductances in intact snail bursting neuron are regulated by neuropeptides. Time courses of the membrane potential and [Ca2+]inwere employed to analyse different regimes in the model. Histograms of interspike intervals, autocorrelograms, spectral characteristics, one-dimensional return maps, phase plane trajectories, positive Lyapunov exponent and especially cascades of period-doubling bifurcations demonstrate that approaches to chaos were generated. The bifurcation diagram as a function ofgB*and the ([Ca2+]in-V) phase diagram of initial conditions reveal fractal features. It has been observed that a short-lasting depolarizing current or elevation of [Ca2+]inmay evoke transformation of chaotic activity into a regular bursting one. These kinds of transitions do not require any changes in the parameters of the model. The results demonstrate that chaotic regimes of neuronal activity modulated by neuropeptides may play a relevant role in information processing and storage at the level of a single neuron.},

	abstract = {The complex and melodic nature of many birds' songs has raised interest in potential parallels between avian vocal sequences and human speech. The similarities between birdsong and speech in production and learning are well established, but surprisingly little is known about how birds perceive song sequences. One popular laboratory songbird, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), has recently attracted attention as an avian model for human speech, in part because the male learns to produce the individual elements in its song motif in a fixed sequence. But psychoacoustic evidence shows that adult zebra finches are relatively insensitive to the sequential features of song syllables. Instead, zebra finches and other birds seem to be exquisitely sensitive to the acoustic details of individual syllables to a degree that is beyond human hearing capacity. Based on these findings, we present a finite-state model of zebra finch perception of song syllable sequences and discuss the rich informational capacity of their vocal system. Furthermore, we highlight the abilities of budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus), a parrot species, to hear sequential features better than zebra finches and suggest that neurophysiological investigations comparing these species could prove fruitful for uncovering neural mechanisms for auditory sequence perception in human speech.

	abstract = {▪ Abstract A complete understanding of sensory and motor processing requires characterization of how the nervous system processes time in the range of tens to hundreds of milliseconds (ms). Temporal processing on this scale is required for simple sensory problems, such as interval, duration, and motion discrimination, as well as complex forms of sensory processing, such as speech recognition. Timing is also required for a wide range of motor tasks from eyelid conditioning to playing the piano. Here we review the behavioral, electrophysiological, and theoretical literature on the neural basis of temporal processing. These data suggest that temporal processing is likely to be distributed among different structures, rather than relying on a centralized timing area, as has been suggested in internal clock models. We also discuss whether temporal processing relies on specialized neural mechanisms, which perform temporal computations independent of spatial ones. We suggest that, given the intricate link between temporal and spatial information in most sensory and motor tasks, timing and spatial processing are intrinsic properties of neural function, and specialized timing mechanisms such as delay lines, oscillators, or a spectrum of different time constants are not required. Rather temporal processing may rely on state-dependent changes in network dynamics.},

	abstract = {The brain's decoding of fast sensory streams is currently impossible to emulate, even approximately, with artificial agents. For example, robust speech recognition is relatively easy for humans but exceptionally difficult for artificial speech recognition systems. In this paper, we propose that recognition can be simplified with an internal model of how sensory input is generated, when formulated in a Bayesian framework. We show that a plausible candidate for an internal or generative model is a hierarchy of ‘stable heteroclinic channels’. This model describes continuous dynamics in the environment as a hierarchy of sequences, where slower sequences cause faster sequences. Under this model, online recognition corresponds to the dynamic decoding of causal sequences, giving a representation of the environment with predictive power on several timescales. We illustrate the ensuing decoding or recognition scheme using synthetic sequences of syllables, where syllables are sequences of phonemes and phonemes are sequences of sound-wave modulations. By presenting anomalous stimuli, we find that the resulting recognition dynamics disclose inference at multiple time scales and are reminiscent of neuronal dynamics seen in the real brain.},

The species has the advantage of being a hermaphrodite and can both cross- and self-mate, which greatly facilitates genetic approaches. The establishment of body-handedness, or chiromorphogenesis, is a major topic of study, since chirality is evident in the shell coiling. Chirality is maternally inherited, and only recently a gene-editing approach identified the actin-related gene Lsdia1 as the key handedness determinant.

Major advances are emerging at the intersection of neuroscience with technology and computing. This new science of the brain combines high-quality research, data integration across multiple scales, a new culture of multidisciplinary large-scale collaboration and translation into applications. As pioneered in Europe’s Human Brain Project (HBP), a systematic approach will be essential for meeting the coming decade’s pressing medical and technological challenges.

	abstract = {1. A simple inexpensive method is described for culturing L. s. appressa in large numbers in relatively small space through an indefinite number of generations. This method involves rearing the snails in three to ten liters of aerated water in deep covered glass jars located in subdued natural light, with approximately two adult snails to each liter of water. The water used is deep well water rich in calcium and magnesium and alkaline in reaction. The jars are cleaned and the water changed weekly, or bimonthly at the longest, and in winter the cold water is warmed to the prior temperature of the aquarium before the snails are placed in it. A small quantity of fine sand, used in trituration of food by the snail gizzard, is furnished in the aquaria. Loose green head lettuce leaves are kept available in the aquaria most of the time; and weekly, wheat cereal cooked in milk and supplemented by a mixture of balanced salts is added. 2. Prehatching mortality by this method is negligible. Sexual maturity is reached in about three months and the average final length of snails reached is between fifty and fifty-five mm. The longest snail ever cultured attained a length of 62.5 mm. The maximum life span of the snail under these cultural conditions is fourteen months. 3. Observations on crawling and feeding, movements concerned with respiration, overcrowding, copulation, oviposition and egg production, gross embryology, hatching, exchange of water for air in the lung, desiccation, etc., are recorded. 4. Egg production was approximately doubled by the addition of cooked wheat cereal to the normal lettuce diet. Non-copulating snails, kept in solitary culture through their sexually mature existence, laid a greater number of eggs per snail than copulating snails living in a group. Snails kept in group culture started ovipositing sooner than in solitary culture. In individual snails the maximum length of egg masses per day increased sharply shortly after egg laying commenced, reached a peak somewhere in the middle of the egg laying period and then gradually tapered at the end. Oviposition in snails kept in solitary culture occurred in periods of variable duration alternating with rest periods.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we suggest that cortical anatomy recapitulates the temporal hierarchy that is inherent in the dynamics of environmental states. Many aspects of brain function can be understood in terms of a hierarchy of temporal scales at which representations of the environment evolve. The lowest level of this hierarchy corresponds to fast fluctuations associated with sensory processing, whereas the highest levels encode slow contextual changes in the environment, under which faster representations unfold. First, we describe a mathematical model that exploits the temporal structure of fast sensory input to track the slower trajectories of their underlying causes. This model of sensory encoding or perceptual inference establishes a proof of concept that slowly changing neuronal states can encode the paths or trajectories of faster sensory states. We then review empirical evidence that suggests that a temporal hierarchy is recapitulated in the macroscopic organization of the cortex. This anatomic-temporal hierarchy provides a comprehensive framework for understanding cortical function: the specific time-scale that engages a cortical area can be inferred by its location along a rostro-caudal gradient, which reflects the anatomical distance from primary sensory areas. This is most evident in the prefrontal cortex, where complex functions can be explained as operations on representations of the environment that change slowly. The framework provides predictions about, and principled constraints on, cortical structure–function relationships, which can be tested by manipulating the time-scales of sensory input.},

Thus types 6, 4 group, and type 8 cells are motoneurones involved in protraction and the two retraction phases, while the type 5 cell fires in the inactive period.

Specifically, we analyzed conditioning-induced changes in cellular responses in the mechanosensory conditioned stimulus (CS) pathway, in the central pattern generator (CPG) network, and in feeding motoneurons. During training, experimental animals received 15 pairings of lip touch (the CS) with sucrose (the unconditioned stimulus, US). Control animals received 15 random CS and US presentations. Electrophysiological tests on semi-intact preparations made from conditioned animals demonstrated a network correlate of the overall feeding conditioned response, a touch-evoked CPG-driven fictive feeding rhythm. At the motoneuronal level, we found significant conditioning-induced increases in the amplitude of an early touch-evoked EPSP and spike activity, recorded from the B3 feeding motoneuron. Increases in EPSP amplitude and motoneuronal spike activity could occur independently of conditioned fictive feeding. These changes in response recorded at the level of CPG interneurons, and motoneurons were preceded by changes recorded in the CS pathway. This was demonstrated by recording a conditioning-induced increase in the number of touch-evoked spikes in the cerebrobuccal connective, which forms part of the CS pathway. The finding that electrophysiological changes after conditioning can be recorded at multiple sites in this simple system provided an important intermediate level of analysis between whole animal behavior and cellular studies on the synaptic sites of plasticity.},

	abstract = {Dopamine activates two different receptors to produce variability in sign at an identified synapse. Chemical synaptic transmission was investigated at a central synapse between identified neurons in the freshwater snail, Lymnaea stagnalis. The presynaptic neuron was the dopaminergic cell, Right Pedal Dorsal one (RPeD1). The postsynaptic neuron was Visceral Dorsal four (VD4). These neurons are components of the respiratory central pattern generator. The synapse from RPeD1 to VD4 showed variability of sign, i.e., it was either inhibitory (monophasic and hyperpolarizing), biphasic (depolarizing followed by hyperpolarizing phases), or undetectable. Both the inhibitory and biphasic synapse were eliminated by low Ca 2+ /high Mg 2+ saline and maintained in high Ca 2+ /high Mg 2+ saline, indicating that these two types of connections were chemical and monosynaptic. The latency of the inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) in high Ca 2+ /high Mg 2+ saline was ∼43 ms, whereas the biphasic postsynaptic potential (BPSP) had ∼12-ms latency in either normal or high Ca 2+ /high Mg 2+ saline. For a given preparation, when dopamine was pressured applied to the soma of VD4, it always elicited the same response as the synaptic input from RPeD1. Thus, for a VD4 neuron receiving an IPSP from RPeD1, pressure application of dopamine to the soma of VD4 produced an inhibitory response similar to the IPSP. The reversal potentials of the IPSP and the inhibitory dopamine response were both approximately −90 mV. For a VD4 neuron with a biphasic input from RPeD1, pressure-applied dopamine produced a biphasic response similar to the BPSP. The reversal potentials of the depolarizing phase of the BPSP and the biphasic dopamine response were both approximately −44 mV, whereas the reversal potentials for the hyperpolarizing phases were both approximately −90 mV. The hyperpolarizing but not the depolarizing phase of the BPSP and the biphasic dopamine response was blocked by the d-2 dopaminergic antagonist (±) sulpiride. Previously, our laboratory demonstrated that both IPSP and the inhibitory dopamine response are blocked by (±) sulpiride. Conversely, the depolarizing phase of both the BPSP and the biphasic dopamine response was blocked by the Cl − channel antagonist picrotoxin. Finally, both phases of the BPSP and the biphasic dopamine response were desensitized by continuous bath application of dopamine. These results indicate that the biphasic RPeD1 → VD4 synapse is dopaminergic. Collectively, these data suggest that the variability in sign (inhibitory vs. biphasic) at the RPeD1 → VD4 synapse is due to activation of two different dopamine receptors on the postsynaptic neuron VD4. This demonstrates that two populations of receptors can produce two different forms of transmission, i.e., the inhibitory and biphasic forms of the single RPeD1 → VD4 synapse.},

	abstract = {Oscillatory neurons integrate their synaptic inputs in fundamentally different ways than normally quiescent neurons. We show that the oscillation period of invertebrate endogenous pacemaker neurons wanders, producing random fluctuations in the interspike intervals (ISI) on a time scale of seconds to minutes, which decorrelates pairs of neurons in hybrid circuits constructed using the dynamic clamp. The autocorrelation of the ISI sequence remained high for many ISIs, but the autocorrelation of the ΔISI series had on average a single nonzero value, which was negative at a lag of one interval. We reproduced these results using a simple integrate and fire (IF) model with a stochastic population of channels carrying an adaptation current with a stochastic component that was integrated with a slow time scale, suggesting that a similar population of channels underlies the observed wander in the period. Using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, we found that a single integrator and a single moving average with a negative coefficient could simulate both the experimental data and the IF model. Feeding white noise into an integrator with a slow time constant is sufficient to produce the autocorrelation structure of the ISI series. Moreover, the moving average clearly accounted for the autocorrelation structure of the ΔISI series and is biophysically implemented in the IF model using slow stochastic adaptation. The observed autocorrelation structure may be a neural signature of slow stochastic adaptation, and wander generated in this manner may be a general mechanism for limiting episodes of synchronized activity in the nervous system.},

The period of the gastric rhythm is typically 5-10 s, whereas the period of the pyloric rhythm is approximately 1 s. 2. In the STG of the crab, Cancer borealis, we find routinely that many motor neurons are active in time with both the pyloric and gastric rhythms. We rigorously identified the motor neurons according to the muscles they innervate. Some neurons usually classified as members of the pyloric network can be active in time with the gastric rhythm. All of the gastric motor neurons except the dorsal gastric (DG) neuron can generate pyloric-timed firing patterns. 3. Two motor neurons innervate muscles found in several different regions of the stomach. The inferior cardiac (IC) neuron, usually considered part of the pyloric network, innervates cardiac sac, gastric mill, and pyloric muscles. The lateral posterior gastric (LPG) neurons innervate muscles of both the gastric mill and the pyloric chamber. 4. These data show that the gastric and pyloric networks in the crab are not separate groups of neurons that independently generate two different rhythmic behaviors. Rather, these neurons together provide a synaptically connected pool of neurons from which many different pattern-generating circuits can be assembled, under different physiological conditions.},

Up until now, these effects have been shown in rodents and humans only. Little is known about their evolutionary origin or biological basis, and the underlying cellular mechanisms also remain relatively elusive. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that preceding motor activity accelerates decision making in an invertebrate, the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. To investigate decision making in a novel environment, snails, which normally live in water, were placed on a flat dry surface to simulate the potentially threatening consequence of being in an arid environment. This stimulus initiated two distinct phases in snail behaviour: slow circular movements, followed by intense locomotion in a chosen direction. The first phase was prolonged when the test arena was symmetrically lit, compared with one with an apparent gradient of light. However, forced muscular locomotion for 2 h prior to the test promoted the transition from random circular motions to a directional crawl, accompanied by an increase in crawling speed but with no effect on the choice of direction. Intense locomotion for 2 h also produced a strong excitatory effect on the activity of serotonergic neurons in L. stagnalis. Our results suggest that the beneficial effects of physical exercise on cognitive performance in mammals might have deep roots in evolution, granting the opportunity to unravel the origins of such effects at the single-neuron and network levels.},

The model includes a slow-wave generating mechanism, a spike-generating mechanism, an inward Ca current, intracellular Ca ions, [Ca2+](im), their fast buffering and uptake by intracellular Ca stores, and a [Ca2+](im)-inhibited Ca current. Chemosensitive voltage-activated conductance, g(B)(*) responsible for termination of the spike burst, and chemosensitive sodium conductance, g(Na)(*), responsible for the depolarizing phase of the slow-wave, were used as control parameters. These conductances in intact snail bursting neuron are regulated by neuropeptides. Time courses of the membrane potential and [Ca2+](in) were employed to analyse different regimes in the model. Histograms of interspike intervals, autocorrelograms, spectral characteristics, one-dimensional return maps, phase plane trajectories, positive Lyapunov exponent and especially cascades of period-doubling bifurcations demonstrate that approaches to chaos were generated. The bifurcation diagram as a function of g(B)(*) and the ([Ca2+](in)-V) phase diagram of initial conditions reveal fractal features. It has been observed that a short-lasting depolarizing current or elevation of [Ca2+](in) may evoke transformation of chaotic activity into a regular bursting one. These kinds of transitions do not require any changes in the parameters of the model. The results demonstrate that chaotic regimes of neuronal activity modulated by neuropeptides may play a relevant role in information processing and storage at the level of a single neuron.},

Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information. We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust. Contrary to conventional wisdom, robots accelerated the spread of true and false news at the same rate, implying that false news spreads more than the truth because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it.},

We test the hypothesis that it inhibits neurons at all levels of the feeding system, using a combination of anatomy, physiology and pharmacology. There is just one PlB in each pleural ganglion. Its axon traverses the pedal and cerebral ganglia, running into the buccal ganglia. It has neuropilar branches in the regions of the cerebral and buccal ganglia where neurons that are active during feeding also branch. Activation of the PlB blocks fictive feeding, whether the feeding rhythm occurs spontaneously or is driven by a modulatory interneuron. The PlB inhibits all the neurons in the feeding network, including protraction and retraction motoneurons, central pattern generator interneurons, buccal modulatory interneurons (SO, OC), and cerebral modulatory interneurons (CV1, CGC). Only the CV1 interneuron shows discrete 1:1 IPSPs; all other effects are slow, smooth hyperpolarizations. All connections persist in Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ -rich saline, which reduces polysynaptic effects. The inhibitory effects are mimicked by 0.5 to 100 μmoll -1 FMRFamide, which the PlB soma contains.

Understanding central pattern generator (CPG) circuits requires a detailed knowledge of the intrinsic cellular properties of the constituent neurons. These properties are poorly understood in most CPGs because of the complexity resulting from interactions with other neurons of the circuit. This is also the case in the feeding network of the snail, Lymnaea, one of the best-characterized CPG networks. We addressed this problem by isolating the interneurons comprising the feeding CPG in cell culture, which enabled us to study their basic intrinsic electrical and pharmacological cellular properties without interference from other network components. These results were then related to the activity patterns of the neurons in the intact feeding network. The most striking finding was the intrinsic generation of plateau potentials by medial N1 (N1M) interneurons. This property is probably critical for rhythm generation in the whole feeding circuit because the N1M interneurons are known to play a pivotal role in the initiation of feeding cycles in response to food. Plateau potential generation in another cell type, the ventral N2 (N2v), appeared to be conditional on the presence of acetylcholine. Examination of the other isolated feeding CPG interneurons [lateral N1 (N1L), dorsal N2 (N2d), phasic N3 (N3p)] and the modulatory slow oscillator (SO) revealed no significant intrinsic properties in relation to pattern generation. Instead, their firing patterns in the circuit appear to be determined largely by cholinergic and glutama-tergic synaptic inputs from other CPG interneurons, which were mimicked in culture by application of these transmitters. This is an example of a CPG system where the initiation of each cycle appears to be determined by the intrinsic properties of a key interneuron, N1M, but most other features of the rhythm are probably determined by network interactions.},

Dissociated networks respond to transmitters, their blockers and many other pharmacological substances, including neurotoxic compounds. In this paper we present results related to the effects, both acute (i.e. 1. hour after the treatment) and chronic (3. days after the treatment), of increasing glutamatergic transmission induced by the application of rising concentrations of glutamate and its agonists (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid - AMPA, N-methyl-D-aspartate - NMDA and AMPA together with cyclothiazide - CTZ). Increase of available glutamate was obtained in two ways: 1) by direct application of exogenous glutamate and 2) by inhibiting the clearance of the endogenously released glutamate through DL-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartate (TBOA). Our findings show that fine modulations (i.e. low concentrations of drug) of the excitatory synaptic transmission are reflected in the electrophysiological activation of the network, while intervention leading to excessive direct stimulation of glutamatergic pathways (i.e. medium and high concentrations of drug) results in the abolishment of the electrophysiological activity and eventually cell death. The results obtained by means of the MEA recordings have been compared to the analysis of cell viability to confirm the excitotoxic effect of the applied drug. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that MEA-coupled cortical networks are very sensitive to pharmacological manipulation of the excitatory ionotropic glutamatergic transmission and might provide sensitive endpoints to detect acute and chronic neurotoxic effects of chemicals and drugs for predictive toxicity testing. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

CV1 interneurones produced facilitating excitatory postsynaptic potentials in N1 interneurones of the buccal central pattern generator for feeding. Connections with N2 interneurones were not found. 3. The CV1 population could be separated into two subgroups. CV1a received strong synaptic feedback in phase with the buccal rhythm, leading to strong bursting during generation of feeding motor output. CV1b received only weak feedback, and often fired continuously when depolarized. 4. Unitary inhibitory postsynaptic potentials were characteristic of all CV1 neurones, but were only visible in CV1b when it was depolarized.

The spike density function (SDF) obtained by convolving the spike train with smooth and continuous kernel function proves to be a more appropriate approach in characterization of the firing pattern. The resulting time-function is a continuous and derivable one, thus it can be used as a dynamical variable of the neuronal activity. In the present paper applications of SDF in analysis of the firing patterns of Lymnaea neurons are described and its performance is compared to other quantitative methods.},

	abstract = {An important modulatory cell type, found in all molluscan feeding networks, was investigated using two-electrode voltage- and current-clamp methods. In the cerebral giant cells of Lymnaea, a transient inward Na+ current was identified with activation at -58 ± 2 mV. It was sensitive to tetrodotoxin only in high concentrations (≈ 50\% block at 100 μM), a characteristic of Na+ channels in many molluscan neurons. A much smaller low-threshold persistent Na+ current (activation at {\textbackslash}textless-90 mV) was also identified. Two purely voltage-sensitive outward K+ currents were also found: (i) a transient A-current type which was activated at -59 ± 4 mV and blocked by 4-aminopyridine; (ii) a sustained tetraethylammonium-sensitive delayed rectifier current which was activated at -47 ± 2 mV. There was also evidence that a third, Ca2+-activated, K+ channel made a contribution to the total outward current. No inwardly rectifying currents were found. Two Ca2+ currents were characterized: (i) a transient low-voltage (-65 ± 2 mV) activated T-type current, which was blocked in NiCl2 (2 mM) and was completely inactivated at ≈-50 mV; (ii) A sustained high voltage (-40 ± 1 mV) activated current, which was blocked in CdCl2 (100 μM) but not in ømega-conotoxin GVIA (10 μM), ømega-agatoxin IVA (500 nM) or nifedipine (10 μM). This current was enhanced in Ba2+ saline. Current-clamp experiments revealed how these different current types could define the membrane potential and firing properties of the cerebral giant cells, which are important in shaping the wide-acting modulatory influence of this neuron on the rest of the feeding network.},

Here we explored the possibility that the physiological diversity of mossy fiber (MF) to granule cell (GC) synapses in the mouse vestibulocerebellum may contribute to the processing of coincident multisensory information at the level of individual GCs. We found that the strength and short-term dynamics of individual MF-GC synapses can act as biophysical signatures for primary vestibular, secondary vestibular and visual input pathways. Most GCs receive inputs from different modalities, which, when coactivated, produced enhanced GC firing rates and distinct first spike latencies. Thus, pathway-specific synaptic response properties permit temporal coding of correlated multisensory inputs by single GCs, thereby enriching sensory representation and facilitating pattern separation.},

	abstract = {Electrically coupled neurons communicate through channel assemblies called gap junctions, which mediate the transfer of current from one cell to another. Electrical synapses ensure spike synchronization and reliable transmission, which influences bursting patterns and firing frequency. The present study concerns an electrically coupled two-neuron network in the gastropod mollusc, Lymnaea stagnalis. The neurons, designated Visceral Dorsal 1 (VD1) and Right Parietal Dorsal 2 (RPD2), are peptidergic, innervate aspects of the cardio-respiratory system, and show strong coupling, such that they fire synchronously. Using dual sharp-electrode current-clamp recording and morphological staining in isolated brain preparations, the hypothesis that the electrical synapse is necessary for accurate network output was tested. We found that both cells make extensive projections within and out of the brain, including across the visceral-parietal connective, which links VD1 and RPD2. Cutting this connective uncoupled the neurons and disrupted the firing rate and pattern of RPD2 more than VD1, consistent with VD1 being the master and RPD2 the follower. The electrical synapse was inhibited by select gap junction blockers, with niflumic acid and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid decreasing the VD1→RPD2 and RPD2→VD1 coupling coefficients, whereas carbenoxolone, α-glycyrrhetinic acid, meclofenamic acid, and quinine were ineffective. There was little-to-no impact on VD1 虠 RPD2 firing synchrony or frequency when coupling was reduced pharmacologically. However, in the presence of gap junction blockers, suppressing the activity of VD1 by prolonged hyperpolarization revealed a distinct, low-frequency firing pattern in RPD2. This suggests that strong electrical coupling is key to maintaining a synchronous output and proper firing rate.},

Here, we use simultaneous EEG-fMRI to localise the source of delta brush events in 10 preterm infants aged 32–36 postmenstrual weeks. The most frequent patterns were left and right posterior-temporal delta brushes which were associated in the left hemisphere with ipsilateral BOLD activation in the insula only; and in the right hemisphere in both the insular and temporal cortices. This direct measure of neural and hemodynamic activity shows that the insula, one of the most densely connected hubs in the developing cortex, is a major source of the transient bursting events that are critical for brain maturation.},

	abstract = {Sensory input plays a major role in controlling motor responses during most behavioral tasks. The vestibular organs in the marine mollusk Clione, the statocysts, react to the external environment and continuously adjust the tail and wing motor neurons to keep the animal oriented vertically. However, we suggested previously that during hunting behavior, the intrinsic dynamics of the statocyst network produce a spatiotemporal pattern that may control the motor system independently of environmental cues. Once the response is triggered externally, the collective activation of the statocyst neurons produces a complex sequential signal. In the behavioral context of hunting, such network dynamics may be the main determinant of an intricate spatial behavior. Here, we show that (1) during fictive hunting, the population activity of the statocyst receptors is correlated positively with wing and tail motor output suggesting causality, (2) that fictive hunting can be evoked by electrical stimulation of the statocyst network, and (3) that removal of even a few individual statocyst receptors critically changes the fictive hunting motor pattern. These results indicate that the intrinsic dynamics of a sensory network, even without its normal cues, can organize a motor program vital for the survival of the animal.},

	abstract = {One contribution of 16 to a discussion meeting issue 'Homology and convergence in nervous system evolution'. Comparisons of rhythmic movements and the central pattern generators (CPGs) that control them uncover principles about the evolution of behaviour and neural circuits. Over the course of evolutionary history, gradual evolution of behaviours and their neural circuitry within any lineage of animals has been a predominant occurrence. Small changes in gene regulation can lead to divergence of circuit organization and corresponding changes in behaviour. However, some behavioural divergence has resulted from large-scale rewiring of the neural network. Divergence of CPG circuits has also occurred without a corresponding change in behaviour. When analogous rhythmic behaviours have evolved independently, it has generally been with different neural mechanisms. Repeated evolution of particular rhythmic behaviours has occurred within some lineages due to parallel evolution or latent CPGs. Particular motor pattern generating mechanisms have also evolved independently in separate lineages. The evolution of CPGs and rhythmic behaviours shows that although most behaviours and neural circuits are highly conserved, the nature of the behaviour does not dictate the neural mechanism and that the presence of homologous neural components does not determine the behaviour. This suggests that although behaviour is generated by neural circuits, natural selection can act separately on these two levels of biological organization.},

Due to experimental limitations, it is usually difficult to address the role of each of these properties separately. We have done so by using the crustacean stomatogastric CPG and the dynamic clamp technique to measure how the network responds to the selective modification of an individual important synapse. Our results show that the burst periods and the phase lags between the constrictor (LP) and dilator (PD) neurons across preparations showed significant variability during equivalent experimental manipulations. Despite this variability, the ratio between the change in the burst period and the change in the phase lag between the same neurons was tightly preserved in all preparations, revealing a dynamical invariant in the system. This dynamical invariant was preserved despite the individual variability in the period and phase lag measurements, suggesting a tightly regulated constraint between the parameters of the network. © Springer-Verlag 2007.},

In this chapter we review some of the most popular models of neurons and neural networks that help us understand how living systems perform information processing. Beyond the fundamental goal of understanding the function of the nervous system, the lessons learned from these models can also be used to build bio-inspired paradigms of artificial intelligence and robotics.},

	abstract = {An essential question raised after the observation of highly variable bursting activity in individual neurons of Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) is how an assembly of such cells can cooperatively act to produce regular signals to motor systems. It is well known that some neurons in the lobster stomatogastric ganglion have a highly irregular spiking-bursting behavior when they are synaptically isolated from any connection in the CPG. Experimental recordings show that periodic stimuli on a single neuron can regulate its firing activity. Other evidence demonstrates that specific chemical and/or electrical synapses among neurons also induce the regularization of the rhythms. In this paper we present a modeling study in which a slow subcellular dynamics, the exchange of calcium between an intracellular store and the cytoplasm, is responsible for the origin and control of the irregular spiking-bursting activity. We show this in simulations of single cells under periodic driving and in minimal networks where the cooperative activity can induce regularization. While often neglected in the description of realistic neuron models, subcellular processes with slow dynamics may play an important role in information processing and short-term memory of spiking-bursting neurons. ©2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {Conductance-based models of neurons from the lobster stomatogastric ganglion (STG) have been developed to understand the observed chaotic behavior of individual STG neurons. These models identify an additional slow dynamical process - calcium exchange and storage in the endoplasmic reticulum - as a biologically plausible source for the observed chaos in the oscillations of these cells. In this paper we test these ideas further by exploring the dynamical behavior when two model neurons are coupled by electrical or gap junction connections. We compare in detail the model results to the laboratory measurements of electrically-coupled neurons that we reported earlier. The experiments on the biological neurons varied the strength of the effective coupling by applying a parallel, artificial synapse, which changed both the magnitude and polarity of the conductance between the neurons. We observed a sequence of bifurcations that took the neurons from strongly synchronized in-phase behavior, through uncorrelated chaotic oscillations to strongly synchronized - and now regular - out-of-phase behavior. The model calculations reproduce these observations quantitatively, indicating that slow subcellular processes could account for the mechanisms involved in the synchronization and regularization of the otherwise individual chaotic activities.},

	abstract = {There are many types of neural networks involved in the sequential motor behavior of animals. For high species, the control and coordination of the network dynamics is a function of the higher levels of the central nervous system, in particular the cerebellum. However, in many cases, especially for invertebrates, such coordination is the result of direct synaptic connections between small circuits. We show here that even the chaotic sequential activity of small model networks can be coordinated by electrotonic synapses connecting one or several pairs of neurons that belong to two different networks. As an example, we analyzed the coordination and synchronization of the sequential activity of two statocyst model networks of the marine mollusk Clione. The statocysts are gravity sensory organs that play a key role in postural control of the animal and the generation of a complex hunting motor program. Each statocyst network was modeled by a small ensemble of neurons with Lotka-Volterra type dynamics and nonsymmetric inhibitory interactions. We studied how two such networks were synchronized by electrical coupling in the presence of an external signal which lead to winnerless competition among the neurons. We found that as a function of the number and the strength of connections between the two networks, it is possible to coordinate and synchronize the sequences that each network generates with its own chaotic dynamics. In spite of the chaoticity, the coordination of the signals is established through an activation sequence lock for those neurons that are active at a particular instant of time.},

We address the problem of characterizing these patterns under the assumption that the bursts exhibit well-defined firing time distributions. We propose a method for estimating these distributions based on a burst alignment al- gorithm that minimizes the overlap among the firing time distributions of the different spikes within the burst. This method provides a good approximation to the burst's intrinsic temporal structure as a set of firing time distributions. In addition, the method allows labeling the spikes in any particular burst, establishing a correspondence between each spike and the distribution that best explains it, and identifying missing spikes. Our results on both simulated and experimental data from the lobster stomatogastric ganglion show that the proposed method provides a re- liable characterization of the intraburst firing patterns and avoids the errors derived from missing spikes. This method can also be applied to nonbursting neurons as a general tool for the study and the interpretation of firing time distributions as part of a temporal neural code. ©2008 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

Another common property in many CPGs is the remarkable rich spiking-bursting dynamics of their constituent cells, which balance robustness and flexibility to generate their joint coordinated rhythms. In this paper, we use conductance-based models and realistic connection topologies inspired by the crustacean pyloric CPG to address the study of asymmetry factors shaping CPG bursting rhythms. In particular, we assess the role of asymmetric maximal synaptic conductances, time constants and gap-junction connectivity to establish the regularity of half-center oscillator based CPGs. We map and characterize the synaptic parameter space that lead to regular and irregular bursting activity in these networks. The analysis indicates that asymmetric configurations display robust regular rhythms and that large regions of both regular and irregular but coordinated rhythms exist as a function of the asymmetry in the circuit. Our results show that asymmetry both in the maximal conductances and in the temporal dynamics of mutually inhibitory neurons can synergistically contribute to shape wide regimes of regular spiking-bursting activity in central pattern generators. Finally, we discuss how a closed-loop protocol driven by a regularity goal can be used to find and characterize regular regimes when there is not time to perform an exhaustive search, as in most experimental studies.},

Many central pattern generators (CPGs) are built on a basic circuit of reciprocally inhibitory neurons, the minimal configuration that can produce distinct rhythmic patterns for controlling antagonistic muscles. In this paper, we use a closed-loop to control the rhythm of a CPG model based on this minimal network architecture. The closed-loop adapts the maximum conductance of the inhibition to achieve a regularized rhythm departing from an otherwise highly irregular spiking-bursting activity. Our results show that the closed-loop conductance control can rapidly find the best connectivity that leads to the regularization goal. We also discuss several external stimuli that lead to regularized CPG rhythms. We argue that the proposed closed-loop approach can be used to control CPG rhythms in a wide variety of applications in experimental and theoretical research.},

In particular, we illustrate three different examples of goal-driven real-time closed-loop interactions with drug microinjectors, mechanical devices and video event driven stimulation. Modern activity-dependent stimulation protocols can be used to reveal dynamics (otherwise hidden under traditional stimulation techniques), achieve control of natural and pathological states, induce learning, bridge between disparate levels of analysis and for a further automation of experiments.

	abstract = {The inferior olive (IO) is a neural network belonging to the olivo-cerebellar system whose neurons are coupled with electrical synapses and display subthreshold oscillations and spiking activity. The IO is frequently proposed as the generator of timing signals to the cerebellum. Electrophysiological and imaging recordings show that the IO network generates complex spatio-temporal patterns. The generation and modulation of coherent spiking activity in the IO is one key issue in cerebellar research. In this work, we build a large scale IO network model of electrically coupled conductance-based neurons to study the emerging spatio-temporal patterns of its transient neuronal activity. Our modeling reproduces and helps to understand important phenomena observed in IO in vitro and in vivo experiments, and draws new predictions regarding the computational properties of this network and the associated cerebellar circuits. The main factors studied governing the collective dynamics of the IO network were: the degree of electrical coupling, the extent of the electrotonic connections, the presence of stimuli or regions with different excitability levels and the modulatory effect of an inhibitory loop (IL). The spatio-temporal patterns were analyzed using a discrete wavelet transform to provide a quantitative characterization. Our results show that the electrotonic coupling produces quasi-synchronized subthreshold oscillations over a wide dynamical range. The synchronized oscillatory activity plays the role of a timer for a coordinated representation of spiking rhythms with different frequencies. The encoding and coexistence of several coordinated rhythms is related to the different clusterization and coherence of transient spatio-temporal patterns in the network, where the spiking activity is commensurate with the quasi-synchronized subthreshold oscillations. In the presence of stimuli, different rhythms are encoded in the spiking activity of the IO neurons that nevertheless remains constrained to a commensurate value of the subthreshold frequency. The stimuli induced spatio-temporal patterns can reverberate for long periods, which contributes to the computational properties of the IO. We also show that the presence of regions with different excitability levels creates sinks and sources of coordinated activity which shape the propagation of spike wave fronts. These results can be generalized beyond IO studies, as the control of wave pattern propagation is a highly relevant problem in the context of normal and pathological states in neural systems (e.g., related to tremor, migraine, epilepsy) where the study of the modulation of activity sinks and sources can have a potential large impact.},

The model describes the coordination of spatio-temporal patterns in the form of sequential switchings corresponding to different modalities. We formulate the conditions for the existence of a multimodality heteroclinic sequence (MHS) in the phase space of this model.

	abstract = {Dynamical modeling of neural systems and brain functions has a hist ory of success over the last half century. This includes, for example, the explanation and prediction of some features of neural rhythmic behaviors. Many interesting dynamical models of learning and memory based on physiological experiments have been suggested over the last two decades. Dynamical models even of consciousness now exist. Usually these models and results are based on traditional approaches and paradigms of nonlinear dynamics including dynamical chaos. Neural systems are, however, an unusual subject for nonlinear dynamics for several reasons: (i) Even the simplest neural network, with only a few neurons and synaptic connections, has an enormous number of variables and control parameters. These make neural systems adaptive and flexible, and are critical to their biological function. (ii) In contrast to traditional physical systems described by well-known basic principles, first principles governing the dynamics of neural systems are unknown. (iii) Many different neural systems exhibit similar dynamics despite having different architectures and different levels of complexity. (iv) The network architecture and connection strengths are usually not known in detail and therefore the dynamical analysis must, in some sense, be probabilistic. (v) Since nervous systems are able to organize behavior based on sensory inputs, the dynamical modeling of these systems has to explain the transformation of temporal information into combinatorial or combinatorial-temporal codes, and vice versa, for memory and recognition. In this review these problems are discussed in the context of addressing the stimulating questions: What can neuroscience learn from nonlinear dynamics, and what can nonlinear dynamics learn from neuroscience?},

	abstract = {Dynamic clamp is a powerful approach for electrophysiological investigations allowing researchers to introduce artificial electrical components into target neurons to simulate ionic conductances, chemical or electrotonic inputs or connections to other cells. Due to the rapidly changing and potentially large current injections during dynamic clamp, problematic voltage artifacts appear on the electrode used to inject dynamic clamp currents into a target neuron. Dynamic clamp experiments, therefore, typically use two separate electrodes in the same cell, one for recording membrane potential and one for injecting currents. The requirement for two independent electrodes has been a limiting factor for the use of dynamic clamp in applications where dual recordings of this kind are difficult or impossible to achieve. The recent development of an active electrode compensation (AEC) method has overcome some of these prior limitations, permitting artifact-free dynamic clamp experimentation with a single electrode. Here we describe an AEC method for the free dynamic clamp software StdpC. The AEC component of StdpC is the first such system implemented for the use of non-expert users and comes with a set of semi-automated configuration and calibration procedures that facilitate its use. We briefly introduce the AEC method and its implementation in StdpC and then validate it with an electronic model cell and in two different biological preparations.},

	abstract = {In this primer, we give a review of the inverse problem for EEG source localization. This is intended for the researchers new in the field to get insight in the state-of-the-art techniques used to find approximate solutions of the brain sources giving rise to a scalp potential recording. Furthermore, a review of the performance results of the different techniques is provided to compare these different inverse solutions. The authors also include the results of a Monte-Carlo analysis which they performed to compare four non parametric algorithms and hence contribute to what is presently recorded in the literature. An extensive list of references to the work of other researchers is also provided. This paper starts off with a mathematical description of the inverse problem and proceeds to discuss the two main categories of methods which were developed to solve the EEG inverse problem, mainly the non parametric and parametric methods. The main difference between the two is to whether a fixed number of dipoles is assumed a priori or not. Various techniques falling within these categories are described including minimum norm estimates and their generalizations, LORETA, sLORETA, VARETA, S-MAP, ST-MAP, Backus-Gilbert, LAURA, Shrinking LORETA FOCUSS (SLF), SSLOFO and ALF for non parametric methods and beamforming techniques, BESA, subspace techniques such as MUSIC and methods derived from it, FINES, simulated annealing and computational intelligence algorithms for parametric methods. From a review of the performance of these techniques as documented in the literature, one could conclude that in most cases the LORETA solution gives satisfactory results. In situations involving clusters of dipoles, higher resolution algorithms such as MUSIC or FINES are however preferred. Imposing reliable biophysical and psychological constraints, as done by LAURA has given superior results. The Monte-Carlo analysis performed, comparing WMN, LORETA, sLORETA and SLF, for different noise levels and different simulated source depths has shown that for single source localization, regularized sLORETA gives the best solution in terms of both localization error and ghost sources. Furthermore the computationally intensive solution given by SLF was not found to give any additional benefits under such simulated conditions.},

These new methodological advances allow to deconstruct the rich spatiotemporal structure of functional components that dynamically assemble into resting-state networks long been observed using conventional measures of functional connectivity. Applications of these emerging methods demonstrate that changes in functional connectivity are indeed driven by complex reorganization of network interactions, and thus provide valuable observations to build better models of brain function and dysfunction.

	abstract = {The pyloric Central Pattern Generator (CPG) in the lobster has an architecture in which every neuron receives at least one connection from another member of the CPG. We call this a "non-open" network topology. An "open" topology, where at least one neuron does not receive synapses from any other CPG member, is found neither in the pyloric nor in the gastric mill CPG. Here we investigate a possible reason for this topological structure using the ability to perform a biologically functional task as a measure of the efficacy of the network. When the CPG is composed of model neurons that exhibit regular membrane voltage oscillations, open topologies are as able to maximize this functionality as non-open topologies. When we replace these models by neurons which exhibit chaotic membrane voltage oscillations, the functional criterion selects non-open topologies. As isolated neurons from invertebrate CPGs are known in some cases to undergo chaotic oscillations, this suggests that there is a biological basis for the class of non-open network topologies that we observe.},

To illustrate them, we divide the task of designing an example CPG for a modular robot into independent problems. We formulate each problem in a general way and provide a bio-inspired solution for each of them: locomotion information coding, individual module control and inter-module coordination. We analyse the stability of the CPG numerically, and then test it on a real robot. We analyse steady state locomotion and recovery after perturbations. In both cases, the robot is able to autonomously find a stable effective locomotion state. Finally, we discuss how these strategies can result in a more general design approach for CPG-based locomotion.},

For example, robust speech recognition is relatively easy for humans but exceptionally difficult for artificial speech recognition systems. In this paper, we propose that recognition can be simplified with an internal model of how sensory input is generated, when formulated in a Bayesian framework. We show that a plausible candidate for an internal or generative model is a hierarchy of 'stable heteroclinic channels'. This model describes continuous dynamics in the environment as a hierarchy of sequences, where slower sequences cause faster sequences. Under this model, online recognition corresponds to the dynamic decoding of causal sequences, giving a representation of the environment with predictive power on several timescales. We illustrate the ensuing decoding or recognition scheme using synthetic sequences of syllables, where syllables are sequences of phonemes and phonemes are sequences of sound-wave modulations. By presenting anomalous stimuli, we find that the resulting recognition dynamics disclose inference at multiple time scales and are reminiscent of neuronal dynamics seen in the real brain.},

Traditional studies on the interaction of cognitive functions in healthy and disordered brains have used the analyses of the connectivity of several specialized brain networks—the functional connectome. However, emerging evidence suggests that both brain networks and functional spontaneous brain-wide network communication are intrinsically dynamic. In the light of studies investigating the cooperation between different cognitive functions, we consider here the dynamics of hierarchical networks in cognitive space. We show, using an example of behavioural decision-making based on sequential episodic memory, how the description of metastable pattern dynamics underlying basic cognitive processes helps to understand and predict complex processes like sequential episodic memory recall and competition among decision strategies. The mathematical images of the discussed phenomena in the phase space of the corresponding cognitive model are hierarchical heteroclinic networks. One of the most important features of such networks is the robustness of their dynamics. Different kinds of instabilities of these dynamics can be related to ‘dynamical signatures' of creativity and different psychiatric disorders. The suggested approach can also be useful for the understanding of the dynamical processes that are the basis of consciousness.},

	abstract = {Recent experiments have revealed the existence of neural signatures in the activity of individual cells of the pyloric central pattern generator (CPG) of crustacean. The neural signatures consist of cell-specific spike timings in the bursting activity of the neurons. The role of these intraburst neural fingerprints is still unclear. It has been reported previously that some muscles can reflect small changes in the spike timings of the neurons that innervate them. However, it is unclear to what extent neural signatures contribute to the command message that the muscles receive from the motoneurons. It is also unknown whether the signatures have any functional meaning for the neurons that belong to the same CPG or to other interconnected CPGs. In this paper, we use realistic neural models to study the ability of single cells and small circuits to recognize individual neural signatures. We show that model cells and circuits can respond distinctly to the incoming neural fingerprints in addition to the properties of the slow depolarizing waves. Our results suggest that neural signatures can be a general mechanism of spiking-bursting cells to implement multicoding.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0015023},
	abstract = {Neurons react differently to incoming stimuli depending upon their previous history of stimulation. This property can be considered as a single-cell substrate for transient memory, or context-dependent information processing: depending upon the current context that the neuron "sees" through the subset of the network impinging on it in the immediate past, the same synaptic event can evoke a postsynaptic spike or just a subthreshold depolarization. We propose a formal definition of History-Dependent Excitability (HDE) as a measure of the propensity to firing in any moment in time, linking the subthreshold history-dependent dynamics with spike generation. This definition allows the quantitative assessment of the intrinsic memory for different single-neuron dynamics and input statistics. We illustrate the concept of HDE by considering two general dynamical mechanisms: the passive behavior of an Integrate and Fire (IF) neuron, and the inductive behavior of a Generalized Integrate and Fire (GIF) neuron with subthreshold damped oscillations. This framework allows us to characterize the sensitivity of different model neurons to the detailed temporal structure of incoming stimuli. While a neuron with intrinsic oscillations discriminates equally well between input trains with the same or different frequency, a passive neuron discriminates better between inputs with different frequencies. This suggests that passive neurons are better suited to rate-based computation, while neurons with subthreshold oscillations are advantageous in a temporal coding scheme. We also address the influence of intrinsic properties in single-cell processing as a function of input statistics, and show that intrinsic oscillations enhance discrimination sensitivity at high input rates. Finally, we discuss how the recognition of these cell-specific discrimination properties might further our understanding of neuronal network computations and their relationships to the distribution and functional connectivity of different neuronal types.},

The cell-specific effect of STDP is particularly evident in the presence of an oscillatory component in a cell input.

However, little is discussed regarding postural or ambulation command signaling. Auditory prosthesis research continues to represent the majority of literature on BCI signal insertion. Significant hurdles continue in the technological translation of BCI implants. These include developing a stable neural interface, significantly increasing signal processing capabilities, and methods of data transfer throughout the human body. The past few years, however, have provided extraordinary human examples of BCI implant potential.

Hybridization combining more than two modalities is a new trend in brain imaging and prosthesis control. Electroencephalography (EEG), due to its easy use and fast temporal resolution, is most widely utilized in combination with other brain/non-brain signal acquisition modalities, for instance, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), electromyography (EMG), electrooculography (EOG), eye tracker, etc. Three main purposes of hybridization are to increase the number of control commands, improve classification accuracy, and reduce the signal detection time. Currently, such combinations of EEG+fNIRS and EEG+EOG are most commonly employed. Four principal components (i.e., hardware, paradigm, classifiers, features) relevant to accuracy improvement are discussed. In the case of brain signals, motor imagination/movement tasks are combined with cognitive tasks to increase active BCI accuracy. Active and reactive tasks sometimes are combined: motor imagination with steady-state evoked visual potentials (SSVEP), and motor imagination with P300, etc. In the case of reactive tasks, SSVEP is most widely combined with P300 to increase the number of commands. Passive BCIs, however, are rare. After discussing the hardware and strategies involved in the development of hBCI, the second part examines the approaches used to increase the number of control commands and to enhance classification accuracy. The future prospects and the extension of hBCI in real-time applications for daily life scenarios are provided.},

	abstract = {Sensory information reaches the cerebral cortex through the thalamus, which differentially relays this input depending on the state of arousal. Such 'gating' involves inhibition of the thalamocortical relay neurons by the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We reconstructed the thalamocortical circuit as an artificial and biological hybrid network in vitro. With visual input simulated as retinal cell activity, we show here that when the gain in the thalamic inhibitory feedback loop is greater than a critical value, the circuit tends towards oscillations – and thus imposes a temporal decorrelation of retinal cell input and thalamic relay output. This results in the functional disconnection of the cortex from the sensory drive, a feature typical of sleep states. Conversely, low gain in the feedback inhibition and the action of noradrenaline, a known modulator of arousal, converge to increase input output correlation in relay neurons. Combining gain control of feedback inhibition and modulation of membrane excitability thus enables thalamic circuits to finely tune the gating of spike transmission from sensory organs to the cortex.},

	abstract = {Experimental neuroscience is witnessing an increased interest in the development and application of novel and often complex, closed-loop protocols, where the stimulus applied depends in real-time on the response of the system. Recent applications range from the implementation of virtual reality systems for studying motor responses both in mice(1) and in zebrafish(2), to control of seizures following cortical stroke using optogenetics(3). A key advantage of closed-loop techniques resides in the capability of probing higher dimensional properties that are not directly accessible or that depend on multiple variables, such as neuronal excitability(4) and reliability, while at the same time maximizing the experimental throughput. In this contribution and in the context of cellular electrophysiology, we describe how to apply a variety of closed-loop protocols to the study of the response properties of pyramidal cortical neurons, recorded intracellularly with the patch clamp technique in acute brain slices from the somatosensory cortex of juvenile rats. As no commercially available or open source software provides all the features required for efficiently performing the experiments described here, a new software toolbox called LCG(5) was developed, whose modular structure maximizes reuse of computer code and facilitates the implementation of novel experimental paradigms. Stimulation waveforms are specified using a compact meta-description and full experimental protocols are described in text-based configuration files. Additionally, LCG has a command-line interface that is suited for repetition of trials and automation of experimental protocols.},

	abstract = {Background: Current software tools for electrophysiological experiments are limited in flexibility and rarely offer adequate support for advanced techniques such as dynamic clamp and hybrid experiments, which are therefore limited to laboratories with a significant expertise in neuroinformatics. New method: We have developed lcg, a software suite based on a command-line interface (CLI) that allows performing both standard and advanced electrophysiological experiments. Stimulation protocols for classical voltage and current clamp experiments are defined by a concise and flexible meta description that allows representing complex waveforms as a piece-wise parametric decomposition of elementary sub-waveforms, abstracting the stimulation hardware. To perform complex experiments lcg provides a set of elementary building blocks that can be interconnected to yield a large variety of experimental paradigms. Results: We present various cellular electrophysiological experiments in which lcg has been employed, ranging from the automated application of current clamp protocols for characterizing basic electrophysiological properties of neurons, to dynamic clamp, response clamp, and hybrid experiments. We finally show how the scripting capabilities behind a CLI are suited for integrating experimental trials into complex workflows, where actual experiment, online data analysis and computational modeling seamlessly integrate. Comparison with existing methods: We compare lcg with two open source toolboxes, RTXI and RELACS. Conclusions: We believe that lcg will greatly contribute to the standardization and reproducibility of both simple and complex experiments. Additionally, on the long run the increased efficiency due to a CLI will prove a great benefit for the experimental community. ©2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	volume = {44},
	abstract = {A hybrid system in which an olivary neuron was interconnected to an analog simulator was used to study possible mechanisms by which the combined behavior of individual olivary neurons evokes synchronized membrane potential oscillations in a large population of neurons. The analog system was composed of four identical, interconnected oscillating units, each of which was capable of producing a damped sinusoidal oscillation in response to a trigger signal. When the units were coupled to each other, a single trigger pulse to one unit could evoke sustained oscillations. The integrity of the connections within the system was required to maintain these oscillations. In the hybrid system the analog system was reciprocally connected to an olivary neuron in a slice preparation. As in the analog system, the hybrid system could generate sustained oscillations following a trigger pulse to one of the units, as well as following a low threshold Ca spike in the neuron. Activation of the low threshold Ca conductance in the olivary neuron was necessary to achieve both gain and in-phase activity within the hybrid system, and thereby sustain the oscillations. The ability of the hybrid system to generate sustained oscillation is frequency dependent. Sustained oscillations were readily obtained at a "preferred frequency" of 5.2 Hz (n = 7) which was independent on the parameters used by the simulator, or on the membrane potential of the neurons. These results, which demonstrate the advantage of a new experimental approach developed to study rhythmogenesis in inferior olivary neurons, support the hypothesis that the inferior olivary nucleus, acting as an interconnected network of oscillating units, can generate an accurate subthreshold oscillation that serves as an internal time reference. ?? 1991.},

In some of these cells the ionic conductances responsible for their excitability also endow them with autorhythmic electrical oscillatory properties. Chemical or electrical synaptic contacts between these neurons often result in network oscillations. In such networks, autorhythmic neurons may act as true oscillators (as pacemakers) or as resonators (responding preferentially to certain firing frequencies). Oscillations and resonance in the CNS are proposed to have diverse functional roles, such as (i) determining global functional states (for example, sleep-wakefulness or attention), (ii) timing in motor coordination, and (iii) specifying connectivity during development. Also, oscillation, especially in the thalamo-cortical circuits, may be related to certain neurological and psychiatric disorders. This review proposes that the autorhythmic electrical properties of central neurons and their connectivity form the basis for an intrinsic functional coordinate system that provides internal context to sensory input.},

In previous research, the computational properties of subthreshold oscillations and dynamic synapses have been studied separately. Our results show that dynamic synapses can influence different aspects of the dynamics of neuronal subthreshold oscillations. Factors such as maximum hyperpolarization level, oscillation amplitude and frequency or the resulting firing threshold are modulated by synaptic depression, which can even make subthreshold oscillations disappear. This influence reshapes the postsynaptic neuron's resonant properties arising from subthreshold oscillations and leads to specific input/output relations. We also study the neuron's response to another simultaneous input in the context of this modulation, and show a distinct contextual processing as a function of the depression, in particular for detection of signals through weak synapses. Intrinsic oscillations dynamics can be combined with the characteristic time scale of the modulatory input received by a dynamic synapse to build cost-effective cell/channel-specific information discrimination mechanisms, beyond simple resonances. In this regard, we discuss the functional implications of synaptic depression modulation on intrinsic subthreshold dynamics.},

We test the hypothesis that it inhibits neurons at all levels of the feeding system, using a combination of anatomy, physiology and pharmacology. There is just one PlB in each pleural ganglion. Its axon traverses the pedal and cerebral ganglia, running into the buccal ganglia. It has neuropilar branches in the regions of the cerebral and buccal ganglia where neurons that are active during feeding also branch. Activation of the PlB blocks fictive feeding, whether the feeding rhythm occurs spontaneously or is driven by a modulatory interneuron. The PlB inhibits all the neurons in the feeding network, including protraction and retraction motoneurons, central pattern generator interneurons, buccal modulatory interneurons (SO, OC), and cerebral modulatory interneurons (CV1, CGC). Only the CV1 interneuron shows discrete 1:1 IPSPs; all other effects are slow, smooth hyperpolarizations. All connections persist in Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ -rich saline, which reduces polysynaptic effects. The inhibitory effects are mimicked by 0.5 to 100 μmoll -1 FMRFamide, which the PlB soma contains. We conclude that the PlB inhibits neurons in the feeding system at all levels, probably acting though the peptide transmitter FMRFamide. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

The analysis demonstrated strong robustness of transient dynamics in keeping not only the activation sequences but also specific cycle-by-cycle temporal relationships in the form of dynamical invariants. The rich dynamics of neurons and connections balance flexibility and coordination to readily negotiate the interactions between neurons and produce the resultant rhythm. In particular, two dynamical invariants were identified between time intervals that build the sequence, existing even outside steady states. We suggest that invariant temporal sequence relationships could be present in other networks, including those related to brain rhythms, and underlie rhythm programming and functionality.},

In contrast to typical all-or-none action potentials, dCaAPs were graded; their amplitudes were maximal for threshold-level stimuli but dampened for stronger stimuli.

	abstract = {There is more than one way to develop neuronal complexity, and animals frequently use different molecular toolkits to achieve similar functional outcomes. Genomics and metabolomics data from basal metazoans suggest that neural signalling evolved independently in ctenophores and cnidarians/ bilaterians. This polygenesis hypothesis explains the lack of pan-neuronal and pan-synaptic genes across metazoans, including remarkable examples of lineage-specific evolution of neurogenic and signalling molecules as well as synaptic components. Sponges and placozoans are two lineages without neural and muscular systems. The possibility of secondary loss of neurons and synapses in the Porifera/Placozoa clades is a highly unlikely and less parsimonious scenario. We conclude that acetylcholine, serotonin, histamine, dopamine, octopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were recruited as transmitters in the neural systems in cnidarian and bilaterian lineages. By contrast, ctenophores independently evolved numerous secretory peptides, indicating extensive adaptations within the clade and suggesting that early neural systems might be peptidergic. Comparative analysis of glutamate signalling also shows numerous lineage-specific innovations, implying the extensive use of this ubiquitous metabolite and intercellular messenger over the course of convergent and parallel evolution of mechanisms of intercellular communication. Therefore: (i) we view a neuron as a functional character but not a genetic character, and (ii) any given neural system cannot be considered as a single character because it is composed of different cell lineages with distinct genealogies, origins and evolutionary histories. Thus, when reconstructing the evolution of nervous systems, we ought to start with the identification of particular cell lineages by establishing distant neural homologies or examples of convergent evolution. In a corollary of the hypothesis of the independent origins of neurons, our analyses suggest that both electrical and chemical synapses evolved more than once.},

In the feeding system of the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, the extrinsic slow oscillator (SO) interneuron controls the frequency of the feeding rhythm and the N3t (tonic) has a dual role; it is an intrinsic CPG interneuron, but it also suppresses CPG activity in the absence of food, acting as a decision-making element in the feeding circuit. The firing patterns of the SO and N3t neurons and their synaptic connections with the rest of the CPG are known, but how these regulate network function is not well understood. This was investigated by building a computer model of the feeding network based on a minimum number of cells (N1M, N2v and N3t) required to generate the three-phase motor rhythm together with the SO that was used to activate the system. The intrinsic properties of individual neurons were represented using two-compartment models containing currents of the Hodgkin-Huxley type. Manipulations of neuronal activity in the N3t and SO neurons in the model produced similar quantitative effects to food and electrical stimulation in the biological network indicating that the model is a useful tool for studying the dynamic properties of the feeding circuit. The model also predicted novel effects of electrical stimulation of two CPG interneurons (N1M and N2v). When tested experimentally, similar effects were found in the biological system providing further validation of our model. © The Authors (2007).},

OC neurons are swallowing phase interneurons receiving inhibitory inputs in the N1 and N2 phases, and excitatory inputs in the N3 phase of fictive feeding. Although the OC neurons do not always fire during feeding, the feeding rate is significantly ( P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001) higher when both SO and OC fire in each cycle than when only the SO fires. In 28\% of silent preparations, a single stimulation of an OC interneuron evokes the feeding pattern. Repetitive stimulation of the OC interneuron increases the proportion of responsive preparations to 41\%. The OC interneuron not only changes both the feeding rate and reconfigures the pattern. Depolarization of the OC interneurons increases the feeding rate and removes the B3 motor neuron from the firing sequence. Hyperpolarization slows it down (increasing the duration of N1 and N3 phases) and recruits the B3 motor neuron. OC interneurons form synaptic connections onto buccal motor neurons and interneurons but not onto the cerebral (cerebral giant cell) modulatory neurons. OC interneurons are electrically coupled to all N3 phase (B4, B4Cl, B8) feeding motor neurons. They form symmetrical connections with the N3p interneurons having dual electrical (excitatory) and chemical (inhibitory) components. OC interneurons evoke biphasic synaptic inputs on the protraction phase interneurons (SO, N1L, N1M), with a short inhibition followed by a longer lasting depolarization. N2d interneurons are hyperpolarized, while N2v interneurons are slowly depolarized and often fire a burst after OC stimulation. Most motor neurons also receive synaptic responses from the OC interneurons. Although OC and N3p interneurons are both swallowing phase interneurons, their synaptic contacts onto follower neurons are usually different (e.g., the B3 motor neurons are inhibited by OC, but excited by N3p interneurons). Repetitive stimulation of OC interneuron facilitates the excitatory component of the biphasic responses evoked on the SO, N1L, and N1M interneurons, but neither the N2 nor the N3 phase interneurons display a similar longer-lasting excitatory effect. OC interneurons are inhibited by all the buccal feeding interneurons, but excited by the serotonergic modulatory CGC neurons. We conclude that OC interneurons are a new kind of swallowing phase interneurons. Their connections with the buccal feeding interneurons can account for their modulatory effects on the feeding rhythm. As they contain octopamine, this is the first example in Lymnaea that monoaminergic modulation and reconfiguration are provided by an intrinsic member of the buccal feeding network.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater},

	abstract = {In the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis octopamine-containing (OC) interneurons trigger and reconfigure the feeding pattern in isolated CNS by excitation of the central pattern generator. In semi-intact (lip-mouth-CNS) preparations, this central pattern generator is activated by chemosensory inputs. We now test if sucrose application to the lips activates the OC neurons independently of the rest of the feeding central pattern generator, or if the OC interneuron is activated by inputs from the feeding network. In 66\% of experiments, sucrose stimulated feeding rhythms and OC interneurons received regular synaptic inputs. Only rarely (14\%) did the OC interneuron fire action potentials, proving that firing of OC interneurons is not necessary for the sucrose-induced feeding. Prestimulation of OC neurons increased the intensity and duration of the feeding rhythm evoked by subsequent sucrose presentations. One micromolar octopamine in the CNS bath mimicked the effect of OC interneuron stimulation, enhancing the feeding response when sucrose is applied to the lips. We conclude that the modulatory OC neurons are not independently excited by chemosensory inputs to the lips, but rather from the buccal central pattern generator network. However, when OC neurons fire, they release modulatory octopamine, which provides a positive feedback to the network to enhance the sucrose-activated central pattern generator rhythm. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

	abstract = {The interaction between synaptic and intrinsic dynamics can efficiently shape neuronal input-output relationships in response to temporally structured spike trains. We use a neuron model with subthreshold oscillations receiving inputs through a synapse with short-term depression and facilitation to show that the combination of intrinsic subthreshold and synaptic dynamics leads to channel-specific nontrivial responses and recognition of specific temporal structures. We employ the Generalized Integrate-and-Fire (GIF) model, which can be subjected to analytical characterization. We map the temporal structure of spike input trains to the type of spike response, and show how the emergence of nontrivial input-output preferences is modulated by intrinsic and synaptic parameters in a synergistic manner. We demonstrate that these temporal input discrimination properties are robust to noise and to variations in synaptic strength, suggesting that they likely contribute to neuronal computation in biological circuits. Furthermore, we also illustrate the presence of these input-output relationships in conductance-based models. Author summary Neuronal subthreshold oscillations underlie key aspects of information processing in single neuron and network dynamics. Dynamic synapses provide a channel-specific temporal modulation of input information. We combine a neuron model that displays subthreshold oscillations and a dynamic synapse to analytically assess their interplay in processing trains of spike-mediated synaptic currents. Our results show that the co-action of intrinsic and synaptic dynamics builds nontrivial input-output relationships, which are resistant to noise and to changes in synaptic strength. The discrimination of a precise temporal structure of the input signal is shaped as a function of the joint interaction of intrinsic oscillations and synaptic dynamics. This interaction can result in channel-specific recognition of precise temporal patterns, hence greatly expanding the flexibility and complexity in information processing achievable by individual neurons with respect to temporal discrimination mechanisms based on intrinsic neuronal dynamics alone.},

	abstract = {Intracellular recordings were made from rhythm-generating interneurons in the Lymnaea feeding system. The feeding pattern is a three-phase rhythm of interneuronal activity (N1, N2, N3) corresponding to protraction, rasp, and swallow. We describe the firing pattern and anatomy of the premotor interneurons, each of which fires a predominant burst in only one phase of the feeding rhythm. The rhythm can be driven by steady depolarization of N1 cells. The phase of the rhythm is reset by brief stimulation of N2 or N3 interneurons. N1 neurons excite the N2 interneurons, and these in turn inhibit the N1 cells. This recurrent inhibitory pathway can account for the switch from the N1 phase of the feeding cycles to the N2 phase. The endogenous properties of the N2 interneurons are apparently responsible for the termination of N2 bursts. N3 interneurons display postinhibitory rebound (PIR), and this probably contributes to their burst after the end of the N2 inhibitory input. N2 and N3 interneurons inhibit the N1 cells. When the N3 burst dies away, activity in N1 cells resumes under the stimulus of depolarizing current. Interactions between interneurons are mainly by discrete, monophasic postsynaptic potentials, that follow 1:1. They have relatively short latency (2-12 ms) and duration (up to 100 ms). The synaptic connections between the three types of premotor interneurons are sufficient to account for the sequence of activity seen during feeding.},

Individual neurons can be identified as parts of behavioral circuits and their synaptic connectivities determined by electrophysiological recording. The ability to grow Lymnaea neurons in cell culture has allowed the in vitro reconstruction of synapses and neural circuits. Early work focused on using Lymnaea giant neurons to analyse the biophysical properties of neurons or investigated the organization of neuroendocrine peptidergic neural networks involved in growth and reproduction. Since then the neural networks underlying a variety of reflexive and rhythmic behaviors have been investigated including feeding, respiration, defensive withdrawal, locomotion, gravity orientation, and reproduction (copulation and egg-laying). Many of these behaviours are highly dynamic leading to exciting recent studies on the neural and molecular mechanisms underlying simple forms of memory formation (Benjamin et al., 2000; Benjamin \& Kemenes, 2010).},

Here we present the first study that investigates the modulatory actions of the CGCs and their released transmitter 5-HT on the CPG at the cellular level. In the snail, Lymnaea, motoneurons such as the B4, B8, and B4CL cells are part of the feeding CPG and receive serotonergic synaptic inputs from CGCs. These motoneurons were used to investigate the effect of serotonergic modulation on endogenous cellular properties of CPG neurons. Cells were isolated from the intact nervous system, and their properties were examined by pharmacological methods in cell culture. Motoneurons were also grown in coculture with CGCs to compare 5-HT effects with CGC stimulation. Three distinct modulatory effects of exogenously applied 5-HT/CGC activity were seen: all three motoneuron types were depolarized by 5-HT for prolonged periods leading to firing. Conditional bursting accompanied this depolarization in the B4/B8 cells, but not in B4CL cells. The frequency of the bursting was increased with increased CGC tonic firing. An increase in the size of postinhibitory rebound (PIR) occurred with 5-HT application in all three cell types, because of an increase in a CsCl-sensitive, hyperpolarization-activated inward current. Similar modulatory effects on membrane potential, endogenous bursting, and PIR properties could be observed in the intact nervous system and were necessary for motoneuron activation during feeding. Part of the systems gating and frequency control functions of the CGCs appear to be caused by these modulatory effects on feeding motoneurons.},

	abstract = {Understanding central pattern generator (CPG) circuits requires a detailed knowledge of the intrinsic cellular properties of the constituent neurons. These properties are poorly understood in most CPGs because of the complexity resulting from interactions with other neurons of the circuit. This is also the case in the feeding network of the snail, Lymnaea, one of the best-characterized CPG networks. We addressed this problem by isolating the interneurons comprising the feeding CPG in cell culture, which enabled us to study their basic intrinsic electrical and pharmacological cellular properties without interference from other network components. These results were then related to the activity patterns of the neurons in the intact feeding network. The most striking finding was the intrinsic generation of plateau potentials by medial N1 (N1M) interneurons. This property is probably critical for rhythm generation in the whole feeding circuit because the N1M interneurons are known to play a pivotal role in the initiation of feeding cycles in response to food. Plateau potential generation in another cell type, the ventral N2 (N2v), appeared to be conditional on the presence of acetylcholine. Examination of the other isolated feeding CPG interneurons [lateral N1 (N1L), dorsal N2 (N2d), phasic N3 (N3p)] and the modulatory slow oscillator (SO) revealed no significant intrinsic properties in relation to pattern generation. Instead, their firing patterns in the circuit appear to be determined largely by cholinergic and glutamatergic synaptic inputs from other CPG interneurons, which were mimicked in culture by application of these transmitters. This is an example of a CPG system where the initiation of each cycle appears to be determined by the intrinsic properties of a key interneuron, N1M, but most other features of the rhythm are probably determined by network interactions.},

The storage size of the corresponding process is large because of the permutation capacity as a function of control signals in ensembles of these patterns. Extracting low-dimensional functional dynamics from multiple large-scale neural populations is a central problem both in neuro- and cognitive- sciences. Experimental results in the last decade represent a solid base for the creation of low-dimensional models of different cognitive functions and allow moving towards a dynamical theory of consciousness. We discuss here a methodology to build simple kinetic equations that can be the mathematical skeleton of this theory. Models of the corresponding discrete information processing can be designed using the following dynamical principles: (i) clusterization of the neural activity in space and time and formation of information patterns; (ii) robustness of the sequential dynamics based on heteroclinic chains of metastable clusters; and (iii) sensitivity of such sequential dynamics to intrinsic and external informational signals. We analyze sequential discrete coding based on winnerless competition low-frequency dynamics. Under such dynamics, entrainment and heteroclinic coordination leads to a large variety of coding regimes that are invariant in time.},

In songbirds, one prominent site of pre-motor activity is the forebrain robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA), which generates stereotyped sequences of spike bursts during song1 and recapitulates these sequences during sleep2. We show that the stereotyped sequences in RA are driven from nucleus HVC (high vocal centre), the principal pre-motor input to RA3,4. Recordings of identified HVC neurons in sleeping and singing birds show that individual HVC neurons projecting onto RA neurons produce bursts sparsely, at a single, precise time during the RA sequence. These HVC neurons burst sequentially with respect to one another. We suggest that at each time in the RA sequence, the ensemble of active RA neurons is driven by a subpopulation of RA-projecting HVC neurons that is active only at that time. As a population, these HVC neurons may form an explicit representation of time in the sequence. Such a sparse representation, a temporal analogue of the ‘grandmother cell'5 concept for object recognition, eliminates the problem of temporal interference during sequence generation and learning attributed to more distributed representations6,7.},

We used noise input to characterize how input shape influences burst delay of a pyloric neuron, and then used dynamic clamp to examine how burst phase depends on the period, amplitude, duration, and shape of rhythmic synaptic input. Phase constancy across a range of periods required a proportional increase of synaptic duration with period.

	abstract = {During walking, the six legs of a stick insect can be coordinated in different temporal sequences or gaits. Leg coordination in each gait is controlled and stabilized by coordinating mechanisms that affect the action of the segmental neuronal networks for walking pattern generation. At present, the motor program for single walking legs in the absence of movement-related coordinating intersegmental influences from the other legs is not known. This knowledge is a prerequisite for the investigation of the segmental neuronal mechanisms that control the movements of a leg and to study the effects of intersegmental coordinating input. A stick insect single middle leg walking preparation has been established that is able to actively perform walking movements on a treadband. The walking pattern showed a clear division into stance and swing phases and, in the absence of ground contact, the leg performed searching movements. We describe the activity patterns of the leg muscles and motoneurons supplying the coxa-trochanteral joint, the femur-tibial joint, and the tarsal leg joints of the middle leg during both walking and searching movements. Furthermore we describe the temporal coordination between them. During walking movements, the coupling between the leg joints was phase-constant; in contrast during searching movements, the coupling between the leg joints was dependent on cycle period. The motor pattern of the single leg generated during walking exhibits similarities with the motor pattern generated during a tripod gait in an intact animal. The generation of walking movements also drives the activity of thoraco-coxal motoneurons of the deafferented and de-efferented thoraco-coxal leg joint in a phase-locked manner, with protractor motoneurons being active during swing and retractor motoneurons being active during stance. These results show that for the single middle leg, a basic walking motor pattern is generated sharing similarities with the tripod gait and that the influence of the motor pattern generated in the distal leg joints is sufficient for driving the activity of coxal motoneurons so an overall motor pattern resembling forward walking is generated.},

These protocols are often difficult to implement due to the temporal precision required when interacting with biological components, which in many cases can only be achieved using real-time technology. In this paper we introduce RTHybrid (www.github.com/GNB-UAM/RTHybrid), a free and open-source software that includes a neuron and synapse model library to build hybrid circuits with living neurons in a wide variety of experimental contexts. In an effort to encourage the standardization of real-time software technology in neuroscience research, we compared different open-source real-time operating system patches, RTAI, Xenomai 3 and Preempt-RT, according to their performance and usability. RTHybrid has been developed to run over Linux operating systems supporting both Xenomai 3 and Preempt-RT real-time patches, and thus allowing an easy implementation in any laboratory. We report a set of validation tests and latency benchmarks for the construction of hybrid circuits using this library. With this work we want to promote the dissemination of standardized, user-friendly and open-source software tools developed for open- and closed-loop experimental neuroscience.},

Although other neuronal properties such as paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and slow PSPs are well characterized, their role in information processing remains unclear. It is possible that these properties contribute to temporal processing in the range of hundreds of milliseconds, a range relevant to most complex sensory processing. A continuous-time neural network model based on integrate-and-fire elements that incorporate PPF and slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) was developed here. The time constants of the PPF and IPSPs were estimated from empirical data and were identical and constant for all elements in the circuit. When these elements were incorporated into a circuit inspired by neocortical connectivity, the network was able to discriminate different temporal patterns. Generalization emerged spontaneously. These results demonstrate that known time-dependent neuronal properties enable a network to transform temporal information into a spatial code in a self-organizing manner--that is, with no need to assume a spectrum of time delays or to custom-design the circuit.},

In particular, we illustrate three different examples of goal-driven real-time closed-loop interactions with drug microinjectors, mechanical devices and video event driven stimulation. Modern activity-dependent stimulation protocols can be used to reveal dynamics (otherwise hidden under traditional stimulation techniques), achieve control of natural and pathological states, induce learning, bridge between disparate levels of analysis and for a further automation of experiments. We argue that closed-loop interaction calls for novel real time analysis, prediction and control tools and a new perspective for designing stimulus-response experiments, which can have a large impact in neuroscience research.},

We first demonstrate the feasibility to quantitatively modulate capacitance in a mathematical neuron model and then confirm the functionality of capacitance clamp in in vitro experiments in granule cells of rodent dentate gyrus with up to threefold virtual capacitance changes. Clamping of capacitance thus constitutes a novel technique to probe and decipher mechanisms of neuronal signaling in ways that were so far inaccessible to experimental electrophysiology.},

The basic patch clamp recording circuit, and designs for improved frequency response are described along with the present limitations in recording the currents from single channels. 4. Procedures for preparation and recording from three representative cell types are given. Some properties of single acetylcholine-activated channels in muscle membrane are described to illustrate the improved current and time resolution achieved with giga-seals. 5. A description is given of the various ways that patches of membrane can be physically isolated from cells. This isolation enables the recording of single channel currents with well-defined solutions on both sides of the membrane. Two types of isolated cell-free patch configurations can be formed: an inside-out patch with its cytoplasmic membrane face exposed to the bath solution, and an outside-out patch with its extracellular membrane face exposed to the bath solution. 6. The application of the method for the recording of ionic currents and internal dialysis of small cells is considered. Single channel resolution can be achieved when recording from whole cells, if the cell diameter is small (less than 20 micrometer). 7.

The existence of CPGs in humans is a matter of debate. Equally elusive is the contribution of CPGs to normal bipedal locomotion. To address these points, we focus on human studies that utilized spinal cord stimulation or pharmacological neuromodulation to generate rhythmic activity in individuals with spinal cord injury, and on neuromechanical modeling of human locomotion. In the absence of volitional motor control and step-specific sensory feedback, the human lumbar spinal cord can produce rhythmic muscle activation patterns that closely resemble CPG-induced neural activity of the isolated animal spinal cord. In this sense, CPGs in humans can be defined by the activity they produce. During normal locomotion, CPGs could contribute to the activation patterns during specific phases of the step cycle and simplify supraspinal control of step cycle frequency as a feedforward component to achieve a targeted speed. Determining how the human CPGs operate will be essential to advance the theory of neural control of locomotion and develop new locomotor neurorehabilitation paradigms.},

Supraspinal inputs play a major role not only in initiating locomotion but also in adapting the locomotor pattern to environmental and motivational conditions. Sensory afferents involved in muscle and cutaneous reflexes have important regulatory functions in preserving balance and ensuring stable phase transitions in the locomotor cycle. Neuromodulators evoke changes in cellular and synaptic properties of CPG neurons, conferring flexibility to CPG circuits. Briefly addressed is the interaction of CPG networks to produce intersegmental coordination for locomotion. Evidence for CPGs in humans is reviewed, and although a comprehensive clinical review is not an objective, examples are provided of animal and human studies that apply knowledge of CPG mechanisms to improve locomotion.

This process is mediated by a rich assortment of voltage-gated ion channels and vesicle exocytosis machinery. Moreover, neuromodulators control the activity of these proteins through G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling cascades. Here, we review cellular mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in axonal ion channel neuromodulation and examine how changes to ion channel function affect AP initiation, AP propagation, and the release of neurotransmitter. We then examine how these mechanisms could modulate synaptic function by focusing on three key features of synaptic information transmission: synaptic strength, synaptic variability, and short-term plasticity. Viewing these cellular mechanisms of neuromodulation from a functional perspective may assist in extending these findings to theories of neural circuit function and its neuromodulation.},

	abstract = {Light-activated ion channels provide a new opportunity to precisely and remotely control neuronal activity for experimental applications in neurobiology. In the past few years, several strategies have arisen that allow light to control ion channels and therefore neuronal function. Light-based triggers for ion channel control include caged compounds, which release active neurotransmitters when photolyzed with light, and natural photoreceptive proteins, which can be expressed exogenously in neurons. More recently, a third type of light trigger has been introduced: a photoisomerizable tethered ligand that directly controls ion channel activity in a light-dependent manner. Beyond the experimental applications for light-gated ion channels, there may be clinical applications in which these light-sensitive ion channels could prove advantageous over traditional methods. Electrodes for neural stimulation to control disease symptoms are invasive and often difficult to reposition between cells in tissue. Stimulation by chemical agents is difficult to constrain to individual cells and has limited temporal accuracy in tissue due to diffusional limitations. In contrast, ion channels that can be directly activated with light allow control with unparalleled spatial and temporal precision. The goal of this chapter is to describe light-regulated ion channels and how they have been tailored to control different aspects of neural activity, and how to use these channels to manipulate and better understand development, function, and plasticity of neurons and neural circuits.},

	abstract = {The axon is responsible for integrating synaptic signals, generating action potentials (APs), propagating those APs to downstream synapses and converting them into patterns of neurotransmitter vesicle release. This process is mediated by a rich assortment of voltage-gated ion channels and vesicle exocytosis machinery. Moreover, neuromodulators control the activity of these proteins through G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling cascades. Here, we review cellular mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in axonal ion channel neuromodulation and examine how changes to ion channel function affect AP initiation, AP propagation, and the release of neurotransmitter. We then examine how these mechanisms could modulate synaptic function by focusing on three key features of synaptic information transmission: synaptic strength, synaptic variability, and short-term plasticity. Viewing these cellular mechanisms of neuromodulation from a functional perspective may assist in extending these findings to theories of neural circuit function and its neuromodulation.},

It has long been recognized that specific groups of ion channels are functionally coupled in mediating ionic fluxes that impact membrane potential, and that these changes in membrane potential impact ion channel gating. Recent studies have identified distinct sets of ion channels that can also physically and functionally associate to regulate the function of either ion channel partner beyond that afforded by changes in membrane potential alone. Here, we review canonical examples of such ion channel partnerships, in which a Ca2+ channel is partnered with a Ca2+-activated K+ channel to provide a dedicated route for efficient coupling of Ca2+ influx to K+ channel activation. We also highlight examples of non-canonical ion channel partnerships between Ca2+ channels and voltage-gated K+ channels that are not intrinsically Ca2+ sensitive, but whose partnership nonetheless yields enhanced regulation of one or the other ion channel partner. We also discuss how these ion channel partnerships can be shaped by the subcellular compartments in which they are found and provide perspectives on how recent advances in techniques to identify proteins in close proximity to one another in native cells may lead to an expanded knowledge of other ion channel partnerships.},

While available comprehensive connectivity maps ( Thomson, West, et al. 2002; Binzegger et al. 2004) have been used in various computational studies, prominent features of the simulated activity such as the spontaneous firing rates do not match the experimental findings. Here, we analyze the properties of these maps to compile an integrated connectivity map, which additionally incorporates insights on the specific selection of target types. Based on this integrated map, we build a full-scale spiking network model of the local cortical microcircuit. The simulated spontaneous activity is asynchronous irregular and cell-type specific firing rates are in agreement with in vivo recordings in awake animals, including the low rate of layer 2/3 excitatory cells. The interplay of excitation and inhibition captures the flow of activity through cortical layers after transient thalamic stimulation. In conclusion, the integration of a large body of the available connectivity data enables us to expose the dynamical consequences of the cortical microcircuitry.},

Although such events have been observed in many neuronal types, it is not well understood how active dendrites contribute to the tuning of neuronal output in vivo. Here we show that dendritic spikes increase the selectivity of neuronal responses to the orientation of a visual stimulus (orientation tuning). We performed direct patch-clamp recordings from the dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the primary visual cortex of lightly anaesthetized and awake mice, during sensory processing. Visual stimulation triggered regenerative local dendritic spikes that were distinct from back-propagating action potentials. These events were orientation tuned and were suppressed by either hyperpolarization of membrane potential or intracellular blockade of NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptors. Both of these manipulations also decreased the selectivity of subthreshold orientation tuning measured at the soma, thus linking dendritic regenerative events to somatic orientation tuning. Together, our results suggest that dendritic spikes that are triggered by visual input contribute to a fundamental cortical computation: enhancing orientation selectivity in the visual cortex. Thus, dendritic excitability is an essential component of behaviourally relevant computations in neurons.},

Then, we obtain a Fokker-Planck equation and illustrate the meaning of the monostable and bistable state in the short-term memory. Furthermore, we study the toggle switch under the interaction of network and noise. Meanwhile, we show that network structure and noise play a vital role in the toggle switch based on network mean first passage time (NMFPT). And we illustrate that the modest clustering coefficient and noise are necessary to maintain memories. Finally, the numerical simulation shows that the analytical results agree with it.},

A systematic study of this channel noise in large ensembles of biophysically detailed model neurons calls for the availability of fast numerical methods. In fact, exact techniques employ the microscopic simulation of the random opening and closing of individual ion channels, usually based on Markov models, whose computational loads are prohibitive for next generation massive computer models of the brain. In this work, we operatively define a procedure for translating any Markov model describing voltage- or ligand-gated membrane ion-conductances into an effective stochastic version, whose computer simulation is efficient, without compromising accuracy. Our approximation is based on an improved Langevin-like approach, which employs stochastic differential equations and no Montecarlo methods. As opposed to an earlier proposal recently debated in the literature, our approximation reproduces accurately the statistical properties of the exact microscopic simulations, under a variety of conditions, from spontaneous to evoked response features. In addition, our method is not restricted to the Hodgkin-Huxley sodium and potassium currents and is general for a variety of voltage- and ligand-gated ion currents. As a by-product, the analysis of the properties emerging in exact Markov schemes by standard probability calculus enables us for the first time to analytically identify the sources of inaccuracy of the previous proposal, while providing solid ground for its modification and improvement we present here.},

	abstract = {To study the effects of stochastic ion channel ﬂuctuations on neural dynamics, several numerical implementation methods have been proposed. Gillespie’s method for Markov Chains (MC) simulation is highly accurate, yet it becomes computationally intensive in the regime of a high number of channels. Many recent works aim to speed simulation time using the Langevin-based Diffusion Approximation (DA). Under this common theoretical approach, each implementation differs in how it handles various numerical difﬁculties—such as bounding of state variables to [0,1]. Here we review and test a set of the most recently published DA implementations (Goldwyn et al., 2011; Linaro et al., 2011; Dangerﬁeld et al., 2012; Orio and Soudry, 2012; Schmandt and Galán, 2012; Güler, 2013; Huang et al., 2013a), comparing all of them in a set of numerical simulations that assess numerical accuracy and computational efﬁciency on three different models: (1) the original Hodgkin and Huxley model, (2) a model with faster sodium channels, and (3) a multi-compartmental model inspired in granular cells. We conclude that for a low number of channels (usually below 1000 per simulated compartment) one should use MC—which is the fastest and most accurate method. For a high number of channels, we recommend using the method by Orio and Soudry (2012), possibly combined with the method by Schmandt and Galán (2012) for increased speed and slightly reduced accuracy. Consequently, MC modeling may be the best method for detailed multicompartment neuron models—in which a model neuron with many thousands of channels is segmented into many compartments with a few hundred channels.},

	abstract = {Background: The phenomena that emerge from the interaction of the stochastic opening and closing of ion channels (channel noise) with the non-linear neural dynamics are essential to our understanding of the operation of the nervous system. The effects that channel noise can have on neural dynamics are generally studied using numerical simulations of stochastic models. Algorithms based on discrete Markov Chains (MC) seem to be the most reliable and trustworthy, but even optimized algorithms come with a non-negligible computational cost. Diffusion Approximation (DA) methods use Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) to approximate the behavior of a number of MCs, considerably speeding up simulation times. However, model comparisons have suggested that DA methods did not lead to the same results as in MC modeling in terms of channel noise statistics and effects on excitability. Recently, it was shown that the difference arose because MCs were modeled with coupled gating particles, while the DA was modeled using uncoupled gating particles. Implementations of DA with coupled particles, in the context of a specific kinetic scheme, yielded similar results to MC. However, it remained unclear how to generalize these implementations to different kinetic schemes, or whether they were faster than MC algorithms. Additionally, a steady state approximation was used for the stochastic terms, which, as we show here, can introduce significant inaccuracies.},

The basic patch clamp recording circuit, and designs for improved frequency response are described along with the present limitations in recording the currents from single channels. 4. Procedures for preparation and recording from three representative cell types are given. Some properties of single acetylcholine-activated channels in muscle membrane are described to illustrate the improved current and time resolution achieved with giga-seals. 5. A description is given of the various ways that patches of membrane can be physically isolated from cells. This isolation enables the recording of single channel currents with well-defined solutions on both sides of the membrane. Two types of isolated cell-free patch configurations can be formed: an inside-out patch with its cytoplasmic membrane face exposed to the bath solution, and an outside-out patch with its extracellular membrane face exposed to the bath solution. 6. The application of the method for the recording of ionic currents and internal dialysis of small cells is considered. Single channel resolution can be achieved when recording from whole cells, if the cell diameter is small (less than 20 micrometer). 7.

	abstract = {Modulatory interneurons that can drive central pattern generators (CPGs) are considered as good candidates for decision-making roles in rhythmic behaviors. Although the mechanisms by which such neurons activate their target CPGs are known in detail in many systems, their role in the sensory activation of CPG-driven behaviors is poorly understood. In the feeding system of the mollusc Lymnaea, one of the best-studied rhythmical networks, intracellular stimulation of either of two types of neuron, the cerebral ventral 1a (CV1a) and the slow oscillator (SO) cells, leads to robust CPG-driven fictive feeding patterns, suggesting that they might make an important contribution to natural food-activated behavior. In this paper we investigated this contribution using a lip-CNS preparation in which feeding was elicited with a natural chemostimulant rather than intracellular stimulation. We found that despite their CPG-driving capabilities, neither CV1a nor SO were involved in the initial activation of sucrose-evoked fictive feeding, whereas a CPG interneuron, N1M, was active first in almost all preparations. Instead, the two interneurons play important and distinct roles in determining the characteristics of the rhythmic motor output; CV1a by modulating motoneuron burst duration and SO by setting the frequency of the ongoing rhythm. This is an example of a distributed system in which (1) interneurons that drive similar motor patterns when activated artificially contribute differently to the shaping of the motor output when it is evoked by the relevant sensory input, and (2) a CPG rather than a modulatory interneuron type plays the most critical role in initiation of sensory-evoked rhythmic activity.},

The N2v --{\textgreater} B3 motor neuron excitatory synaptic response could be mimicked by focal or bath application of -glutamate at concentrations of {\textgreater}/=10(-3) M. Quisqualate and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) were potent agonists for the B3 excitatory glutamate receptor (10(-3) M), whereas kainate only produced very weak responses at the same concentration. This suggested that non-N-methyl--aspartate (NMDA), AMPA/quisqualate receptors were present on the B3 cell. The specific non-NMDA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX; 10(-5) M) blocked 85\% of the excitatory effects on the B3 cell produced by focal application of glutamate (10(-3) M), confirming the presence of non-NMDA receptors. CNQX also blocked the major part of the excitatory postsynaptic potentials on the B3 cell produced by spontaneous or current-evoked bursts of spikes in the N2v cell. As with focal application of glutamate, a small delayed component remained that was CNQX insensitive. This provided direct evidence that glutamate acting via receptors of the non-NMDA, AMPA/quisqualate type were responsible for mediating the main N2v --{\textgreater} B3 cell excitatory response. NMDA at 10(-2) M also excited the B3 cell, but the effects were much more variable in size and absent in one-third of the 25 B3 cells tested. NMDA effects on B3 cells were not enhanced by bath application of glycine at 10(-4) M or reduction of Mg2+ concentration in the saline to zero, suggesting the absence of typical NMDA receptors. The variability of the B3 cell responses to NMDA suggested these receptors were unlikely to be the main receptor type involved with N2v --{\textgreater} B3 excitation. Quisqualate and AMPA at 10(-3) M also mimicked N2v inhibitory effects on the B7 and B8 feeding motor neurons and the modulatory slow oscillator (SO) interneuron, providing further evidence for the role of AMPA/quisqualate receptors. Similar effects were seen with glutamate at the same concentration. However, CNQX could not block either glutamate or N2v inhibitory postsynaptic responses on the B7, B8, or SO cells, suggesting a different glutamate receptor subtype for inhibitory responses compared with those responsible for N2v --{\textgreater} B3 excitation. We conclude that glutamate is a strong candidate transmitter for the N2v cells and that AMPA/quisquate receptors of different subtypes are likely to be responsible for the excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic responses.},

	abstract = {We aimed to show that the paired N2v (N2 ventral) plateauing cells of the buccal ganglia are important central pattern generator (CPG) interneurons of the Lymnaea feeding system. N2v plateauing is phase-locked to the rest of the CPG network in a slow oscillator (SO)-driven fictive feeding rhythm. The phase of the rhythm is reset by artificially evoked N2v bursts, a characteristic of CPG neurons. N2v cells have extensive input and output synaptic connections with the rest of the CPG network and the modulatory SO cell and cerebral giant cells (CGCs). Synaptic input from the protraction phase interneurons N1M (excitatory), N1L (inhibitory), and SO (inhibitory-excitatory) are likely to contribute to a ramp-shaped prepotential that triggers the N2v plateau. The prepotential has a highly complex waveform due to progressive changes in the amplitude of the component synaptic potentials. Most significant is the facilitation of the excitatory component of the SO --{\textgreater} N2v monosynaptic connection. None of the other CPG interneurons has the appropriate input synaptic connections to terminate the N2v plateaus. The modulatory function of acetylcholine (ACh), the transmitter of the SO and N1M/N1Ls, was examined. Focal application of ACh (50-ms pulses) onto the N2v cells reproduced the SO --{\textgreater} N2v biphasic synaptic response but also induced long-term plateauing (20-60 s). N2d cells show no endogenous ability to plateau, but this can be induced by focal applications of ACh. The N2v cells inhibit the N3 tonic (N3t) but not the N3 phasic (N3p) CPG interneurons. The N2v --{\textgreater} N3t inhibitory synaptic connection is important in timing N3t activity. The N3t cells recover from this inhibition and fire during the swallow phase of the feeding pattern. Feedback N2v inhibition to the SO, N1L protraction phase interneurons prevents them firing during the retraction phase of the feeding cycle. The N2v --{\textgreater} N1M synaptic connection was weak and only found in 50\% of preparations. A weak N2v --{\textgreater} CGC inhibitory connection prevents the CGCs firing during the rasp (N2) phase of the feeding cycle. These data allowed a new model for the Lymnaea feeding CPG to be proposed. This emphasizes that each of the six types of CPG interneuron has a unique set of synaptic connections, all of which contribute to the generation of a full CPG pattern.},

	abstract = {1. We used intracellular recording techniques to examine the role of a novel type of protraction phase interneuron, the lateral N1 (N1L) in the feeding system of the snail Lymnaea stagnalis. 2. The N1Ls are a bilaterally symmetrical pair of electrotonically coupled interneurons located in the buccal ganglia. Each N1L sends a single axon to the contralateral buccal ganglia. Their neurite processes are confined to the buccal neuropile. 3. In the isolated CNS, depolarization of an N1L is capable of driving a full (N1--{\textgreater}N2--{\textgreater}N3), fast (1 cycle every 5 s) fictive feeding rhythm. This was unlike the previously described N1 medial (N1M) central pattern generator (CPG) interneurons that were only capable of driving a slow, irregular rhythm. Attempts to control the frequency of the fictive feeding rhythm by injecting varying amounts of steady current into the N1Ls were unsuccessful. This contrasts with a modulatory neuron, the slow oscillator (SO), that has very similar firing patterns to the N1Ls, but where the frequency of the rhythm depends on the level of injected current. 4. The N1Ls' ability to drive a fictive feeding rhythm in the isolated preparation was due to their strong, monosynaptic excitatory chemical connection with the N1M CPG interneurons. Bursts of spikes in the N1Ls generated summating excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in the N1Ms to drive them to firing. The SO excited the N1M cells in a similar way, but the EPSPs are strongly facilitatory, unlike the N1L--{\textgreater}N1M connection. 5. Fast (1 cycle every 5 s) fictive feeding rhythms driven by the N1L occurred in the absence of spike activity in the SO modulatory neuron. In contrast, the N1L was usually active in SO-driven rhythms. 6. The ability of the SO to drive the N1L was due to strong electrotonic coupling, SO--{\textgreater}N1L. The weaker coupling in the opposite direction, N1L--{\textgreater}SO, did not allow the N1L to drive the SO. 7. Experiments on semintact lip-brain preparations allowed fictive feeding to be evoked by application of 0.1 M sucrose to the lips (mimicking the normal sensory input) rather than by injection of depolarizing current. Rhythmic bursting, characteristic of fictive feeding, began in both the SO and N1L at exactly the same time, indicating that these two cell types are activated in "parallel" to drive the feeding rhythm. 8. The N1L is also part of the CPG network. It Excited the N2s and inhibited the N3 phasic (N3p) and N3 tonic (N3t) CPG interneurons like the N1Ms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Intracellular recording techniques were used to examine the electrical properties and behavioral function of a novel type of retraction phase interneuron, the N2 ventral (N2v) cells in the feeding network of the snail Lymnaea. The N2vs were compared with the previously identified N2 cells that now are renamed the N2 dorsal (N2d) cells. The N2vs are a bilaterally symmetrical pair of electrotonically coupled plateauing interneurons that are located on the ventral surfaces of the buccal ganglia. Their main axons project to the opposite buccal ganglion, but they have an additional fine process in the postbuccal nerve. N2v plateaus that outlast the duration of the stimulus can be triggered by depolarizing current pulses and prematurely terminated by applied hyperpolarizing pulses. Gradually increasing the amplitude of depolarizing pulses reveals a clear threshold for plateau initiation. N2v plateauing persists in a high Mg2+/nominally zero Ca2+ saline that blocks chemical synaptic connections, suggesting an endogenous mechanism for plateau generation. The N2vs fire sustained bursts of action potentials throughout the N2/rasp phase of the fictive feeding cycle and control the retraction phase feeding motor neurons. The N2vs excite the B3 and B9 feeding motor neurons to fire during the rasp phase of the feeding cycle. They also inhibit the B7 and B8 feeding motor neurons. The B8 cells recover from inhibition and fire during the following swallowing phase. These synaptic connections appear to be monosynaptic as they persist in high Mg2+/high Ca2+ (HiDi) saline that blocks polysynaptic pathways. Strong current-induced plateaus in the N2vs generate brief inhibitory postsynaptic responses in the B4CL rasp phase motor neurons, but this was due to the indirect N2v --{\textgreater} N2d --{\textgreater} B4CL pathway. The N2vs are coupled electrotonically to the N2d cells, and triggering plateau in a N2v usually induced one or two spikes in a N2d. Previous experiments showed that the N2ds generate plateau potentials during a fictive feeding cycle. Here we show that the main component of the "plateauing" waveform is due to the electrotonic coupling with the N2v cells. The differential synaptic connections of the N2v and N2d cells with retraction phase motor neurons results in a sequence of motor neuron burst activity B9 --{\textgreater} B4CL --{\textgreater} B8 that produces the full retraction (rasp --{\textgreater} swallow) movements of the feeding apparatus (buccal mass). We conclude that the N2v cells are an essential component of the interneuronal network required to produce feeding motor neuron activity.},

Here we present the first study that investigates the modulatory actions of the CGCs and their released transmitter 5-HT on the CPG at the cellular level. In the snail, Lymnaea, motoneurons such as the B4, B8, and B4CL cells are part of the feeding CPG and receive serotonergic synaptic inputs from CGCs. These motoneurons were used to investigate the effect of serotonergic modulation on endogenous cellular properties of CPG neurons. Cells were isolated from the intact nervous system, and their properties were examined by pharmacological methods in cell culture. Motoneurons were also grown in coculture with CGCs to compare 5-HT effects with CGC stimulation. Three distinct modulatory effects of exogenously applied 5-HT/CGC activity were seen: all three motoneuron types were depolarized by 5-HT for prolonged periods leading to firing. Conditional bursting accompanied this depolarization in the B4/B8 cells, but not in B4CL cells. The frequency of the bursting was increased with increased CGC tonic firing. An increase in the size of postinhibitory rebound (PIR) occurred with 5-HT application in all three cell types, because of an increase in a CsCl-sensitive, hyperpolarization-activated inward current. Similar modulatory effects on membrane potential, endogenous bursting, and PIR properties could be observed in the intact nervous system and were necessary for motoneuron activation during feeding. Part of the systems gating and frequency control functions of the CGCs appear to be caused by these modulatory effects on feeding motoneurons.},

Furthermore, we mentioned to sleep deprivation, its effects on memory function, and the potential interaction with serotonin. Although there are thousands of research articles focusing on the relationship between sleep and serotonin; however, the pattern of serotonergic function in sleep deprivation is inconsistent and it seems that serotonin has not a certain role in the effects of sleep deprivation on memory function. Also, we found that the injection type of serotonergic agents (systemic or local), the doses of these drugs (dose-dependent effects), and up- or down-regulation of serotonergic receptors during training with various memory tasks are important issues that can be involved in the effects of serotonergic signaling on sleep–wake cycle, memory function, and sleep deprivation-induced memory impairments.

Both CGCs were filled with fluorescent dyes. Lucifer yellow was used for "soma" kills and injected via intracellular microelectrodes. CGC axons were retrogradely filled with 5 (6)-carboxyfluorescein (5-CF), through the cut ends of the ventro- and lateral buccal nerves, for "axonal" kills. 3. Irradiation of the CGC soma with a blue laser light (0.5 MW/m2) led to a loss of their recorded membrane potentials and the synaptic responses with their postsynaptic cells (feeding motor neurons). CGC coupling and axonal fluorescence were lost after axonal irradiation. 4. The tonic firing rate of CGC axon spikes in peripheral nerve roots following bilateral soma kills was reduced to approximately 15\% of preirradiation levels (n = 2; from 52.5 +/- 3.75 spikes/min to 8.2 +/- 0.95 spikes/min; mean +/- SE) but spike activity was not completely eliminated. 5. The fictive feeding rhythm was evoked by depolarizing a modulatory neuron, the slow oscillator (SO), before and after laser irradiation. Thirty minutes after both the CGCs were irradiated (n = 8), the frequency of the SO-driven feeding rhythm was reduced. Mean fictive feeding rates were reduced from 8.3 to 4.5 cycles/min for soma kills (n = 3) and from 16.2 to 9.6 cycles/min for axonal kills (n = 5; P {\textless} 0.05). 6. The results suggest that the CGCs play a modulatory role in controlling the frequency of oscillation of the feeding central pattern generator (CPG) in Lymnaea. The SO could still drive a full fictive feeding rhythm after irradiation but at a reduced rate. At least in the soma kills, the residual spike activity retained in the distal branches of the CGCs appeared sufficient to allow the SO to drive this slow rhythm.},

Calculations using a model consisting of a symmetrical pair of cells with standard values for the electrotonic parameters show that in this system, for a soma-soma resistance of 20 M omega, the junction cannot be more than 0.16 length constants from the cell bodies. Reduction in coupling due to membrane current losses in such short proximal axon segments is insignificant. Intra-axonal recordings indicate that most of the coupling resistance is located at the junction between VD1 and RPD2, which must therefore be closer to the cell bodies than the limiting value of 0.16 length constants assuming an electrical equivalent model which includes the standard electrotonic parameters. If all the soma-soma resistance is located at the junction, then it could be physically a single array of gap-junction particles. Despite its low conductance (1/20 M omega = 50 nS) and possibly small physical dimensions, the electrotonic synapse is more than sufficient to ensure spike synchrony in the two cells.},

Cinephotography of feeding cycles has confirmed that these correspond to protraction, 2 phases of retraction, and an inactive phase. The 4 phases of muscle activity can also be related to the cycle of neural activity described previously (Benjamin \&amp; Rose, 1979). Thus types 6, 4 group, and type 8 cells are motoneurones involved in protraction and the two retraction phases, while the type 5 cell fires in the inactive period. The combination of physiological and anatomical approaches has led to the suggestion that the single and double input cells described by Benjamin \&amp; Rose (1979) are involved with the control of buccal and oesophageal activity respectively.},

The SO is an interneuron whose axon branches solely within the buccal ganglia. There is only one such cell in each snail. In half the snails the cell body is in the right buccal ganglion and in the other half in the left buccal ganglion. Stimulation of either the SO or one of the N1 pattern-generating interneurons elicits the feeding rhythm, but of all the buccal neurons, only the SO can drive the feeding rhythm at the frequency seen in the intact snail. The SO makes reciprocal excitatory synapses with the N1 interneurons that drive the protraction of the radula. This ensures strong activation of the feeding system. The SO inhibits the N2 interneurons. Postsynaptic potentials evoked by stimulation of the SO facilitate without spike broadening in the SO. The SO is strongly inhibited by N2 and N3 interneurons, which are active during the retraction phase. This gates any excitatory inputs to the SO, probably preventing protraction of the radula while retraction is underway. The results support the idea of a single interneuron capable of driving a hierarchically organized motor system.},

	abstract = {Intracellular recordings were made from rhythm-generating interneurons in the Lymnaea feeding system. The feeding pattern is a three-phase rhythm of interneuronal activity (N1, N2, N3) corresponding to protraction, rasp, and swallow. We describe the firing pattern and anatomy of the premotor interneurons, each of which fires a predominant burst in only one phase of the feeding rhythm. The rhythm can be driven by steady depolarization of N1 cells. The phase of the rhythm is reset by brief stimulation of N2 or N3 interneurons. N1 neurons excite the N2 interneurons, and these in turn inhibit the N1 cells. This recurrent inhibitory pathway can account for the switch from the N1 phase of the feeding cycles to the N2 phase. The endogenous properties of the N2 interneurons are apparently responsible for the termination of N2 bursts. N3 interneurons display postinhibitory rebound (PIR), and this probably contributes to their burst after the end of the N2 inhibitory input. N2 and N3 interneurons inhibit the N1 cells. When the N3 burst dies away, activity in N1 cells resumes under the stimulus of depolarizing current. Interactions between interneurons are mainly by discrete, monophasic postsynaptic potentials, that follow 1:1. They have relatively short latency (2-12 ms) and duration (up to 100 ms). The synaptic connections between the three types of premotor interneurons are sufficient to account for the sequence of activity seen during feeding.},

L5b pyramidal cells have been the subject of extensive experimental and modeling studies, yet conductance-based models of these cells that faithfully reproduce both their perisomatic Na+-spiking behavior as well as key dendritic active properties, including Ca2+ spikes and back-propagating action potentials, are still lacking. Based on a large body of experimental recordings from both the soma and dendrites of L5b pyramidal cells in adult rats, we characterized key features of the somatic and dendritic firing and quantified their statistics. We used these features to constrain the density of a set of ion channels over the soma and dendritic surface via multi-objective optimization with an evolutionary algorithm, thus generating a set of detailed conductance-based models that faithfully replicate the back-propagating action potential activated Ca2+ spike firing and the perisomatic firing response to current steps, as well as the experimental variability of the properties. Furthermore, we show a useful way to analyze model parameters with our sets of models, which enabled us to identify some of the mechanisms responsible for the dynamic properties of L5b pyramidal cells as well as mechanisms that are sensitive to morphological changes. This automated framework can be used to develop a database of faithful models for other neuron types. The models we present provide several experimentally-testable predictions and can serve as a powerful tool for theoretical investigations of the contribution of single-cell dynamics to network activity and its computational capabilities.},

To obtain models as generic as possible, we used data from different preparations in vivo and in vitro, such as rat somatosensory cortex and thalamus, guinea-pig visual and frontal cortex, ferret visual cortex, cat visual cortex and cat association cortex.

This system is the subject of an intensive concerted effort to understand the behaviour of an entire living animal, from the bottom up and the top down. C. elegans locomotion, in particular, has been the subject of a number of models, but there is as yet no general agreement about the key (rhythm generating) elements. In this paper we investigate the role of one component of the locomotion subsystem, namely the body wall muscles, with a focus on the role of inter-muscular gap junctions. We construct a detailed electrophysiological model which suggests that these muscles function, to a first approximation, as mere actuators and have no obvious rhythm generating role. Furthermore, we show that within our model inter-muscular coupling is too weak to have a significant electrical effect. These results rule out muscles as key generators of locomotion, pointing instead to neural activity patterns. More specifically, the results imply that the reduced locomotion velocity observed in unc-9 mutants is likely to be due to reduced neuronal rather than inter-muscular coupling. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

	abstract = {The functional consequences of the laminar organization observed in cortical systems cannot be easily studied using standard experimental techniques, abstract theoretical representations, or dimensionally reduced models built from scratch. To solve this problem we have developed a full implementation of an olfactory bulb microcircuit using realistic three-dimensional inputs, cell morphologies, and network connectivity. The results provide new insights into the relations between the functional properties of individual cells and the networks in which they are embedded. To our knowledge, this is the first model of the mitral-granule cell network to include a realistic representation of the experimentally-recorded complex spatial patterns elicited in the glomerular layer by natural odor stimulation. Although the olfactory bulb, due to its organization, has unique advantages with respect to other brain systems, the method is completely general, and can be integrated with more general approaches to other systems. The model makes experimentally testable predictions on distributed processing and on the differential backpropagation of somatic action potentials in each lateral dendrite following odor learning, providing a powerful three-dimensional framework for investigating the functions of brain microcircuits.},

	abstract = {Fast neuronal oscillations (gamma, 20–80 Hz) have been observed in the neocortex and hippocampus during behavioral arousal. Using computer simulations, we investigated the hypothesis that such rhythmic activity can emerge in a random network of interconnected GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons. Specific conditions for the population synchronization, on properties of single cells and the circuit, were identified. These include the following: (1) that the amplitude of spike afterhyperpolarization be above the GABAA synaptic reversal potential; (2) that the ratio between the synaptic decay time constant and the oscillation period be sufficiently large; (3) that the effects of heterogeneities be modest because of a steep frequency–current relationship of fast-spiking neurons. Furthermore, using a population coherence measure, based on coincident firings of neural pairs, it is demonstrated that large-scale network synchronization requires a critical (minimal) average number of synaptic contacts per cell, which is not sensitive to the network size.
By changing the GABAA synaptic maximal conductance, synaptic decay time constant, or the mean external excitatory drive to the network, the neuronal firing frequencies were gradually and monotonically varied. By contrast, the network synchronization was found to be high only within a frequency band coinciding with the gamma (20–80 Hz) range. We conclude that the GABAA synaptic transmission provides a suitable mechanism for synchronized gamma oscillations in a sparsely connected network of fast-spiking interneurons. In turn, the interneuronal network can presumably maintain subthreshold oscillations in principal cell populations and serve to synchronize discharges of spatially distributed neurons.},

	abstract = {We have developed a two-compartment, eight-variable model of a CA3 pyramidal cell as a reduction of a complex 19-compartment cable model [Traub et al, 1991]. Our reduced model segregates the fast currents for sodium spiking into a proximal, soma-like, compartment and the slower calcium and calcium-mediated currents into a dendrite-like compartment. In each model periodic bursting gives way to repetitive soma spiking as somatic injected current increases. Steady dendritic stimulation can produce periodic bursting of significantly higher frequency (8–20 Hz) than can steady somatic input ({\textless}8 Hz). Bursting in our model occurs only for an intermediate range of electronic coupling conductance. It depends on the segregation of channel types and on the coupling current that flows back-and-forth between compartments. When the soma and dendrite are tightly coupled electrically, our model reduces to a single compartment and does not burst. Network simulations with our model using excitatory AMPA and NMDA synapses (without inhibition) give results similar to those obtained with the complex cable model [Traub et al, 1991; Traub et al, 1992]. Brief stimulation of a single cell in a resting network produces multiple synchronized population bursts, with fast AMPA synapses providing the dominant synchronizing mechanism. The number of bursts increases with the level of maximal NMDA conductance. For high enough maximal NMDA conductance synchronized bursting repeats indefinitely. We find that two factors can cause the cells to desynchronize when AMPA synapses are blocked: heterogeneity of properties amongst cells and intrinsically chaotic burst dynamics. But even when cells are identical, they may synchronize only approximately rather than exactly. Since our model has a limited number of parameters and variables, we have studied its cellular and network dynamics computationally with relative ease and over wide parameter ranges. Thereby, we identify some qualitative features that parallel or are distinguished from those of other neuronal systems; e.g., we discuss how bursting here differs from that in some classical models.},

	abstract = {The electrophysiological properties of the oblique branches of CA1 pyramidal neurons are largely unknown and very difficult to investigate experimentally. These relatively thin dendrites make up the majority of the apical tree surface area and constitute the main target of Schaffer collateral axons from CA3. Their electrogenic properties might have an important role in defining the computational functions of CA1 neurons. It is thus important to determine if and to what extent the back- and forward propagation of action potentials (AP) in these dendrites could be modulated by local properties such as morphology or active conductances. In the first detailed study of signal propagation in the full extent of CA1 oblique dendrites, we used 27 reconstructed three-dimensional morphologies and different distributions of the A-type K+ conductance (KA), to investigate their electrophysiological properties by computational modeling. We found that the local KA distribution had a major role in modulating action potential back propagation, whereas the forward propagation of dendritic spikes originating in the obliques was mainly affected by local morphological properties. In both cases, signal processing in any given oblique was effectively independent of the rest of the neuron and, by and large, of the distance from the soma. Moreover, the density of KA in oblique dendrites affected spike conduction in the main shaft. Thus the anatomical variability of CA1 pyramidal cells and their local distribution of voltage-gated channels may suit a powerful functional compartmentalization of the apical tree.

	abstract = {The coupling of high frequency oscillations (HFOs; \&gt;100 Hz) and theta oscillations (3-12 Hz) in the CA1 region of rats increases during REM sleep, indicating that it may play a role in memory processing. However, it is unclear whether the CA1 region itself is capable of providing major contributions to the generation of HFOs, or if they are strictly driven through input projections. Parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons may play an essential role in these oscillations due to their extensive connections with neighbouring pyramidal cells, and their characteristic fast-spiking. Thus, we created mathematical network models to investigate the conditions under which networks of CA1 fast-spiking PV+ interneurons are capable of producing high frequency population rhythms. We used whole-cell patch clamp recordings of fast-spiking, PV+ cells in the CA1 region of an intact hippocampal preparation in vitro to derive cellular properties, from which we constrained an Izhikevich-type model. Novel, biologically constrained network models were constructed with these individual cell models, and we investigated networks across a range of experimentally determined excitatory inputs and inhibitory synaptic strengths. For each network, we determined network frequency and coherence. Network simulations produce coherent firing at high frequencies (\&gt; 90 Hz) for parameter ranges in which PV-PV inhibitory synaptic conductances are necessarily small and external excitatory inputs are relatively large. Interestingly, our networks produce sharp transitions between random and coherent firing, and this sharpness is lost when connectivity is increased beyond biological estimates. Our work suggests that CA1 networks may be designed with mechanisms for quickly gating in and out of high frequency coherent population rhythms, which may be essential in the generation of nested theta/high frequency rhythms.},

However, little is known about how such networks respond to excitatory synaptic input. To investigate this, we studied electrically coupled Golgi cells (GoC) in the cerebellar input layer. We show with immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and electrophysiology that Connexin-36 is necessary for functional gap junctions (GJs) between GoC dendrites. In the absence of coincident synaptic input, GoCs synchronize their firing. In contrast, sparse, coincident mossy fiber input triggered a mixture of excitation and inhibition of GoC firing and spike desynchronization. Inhibition is caused by propagation of the spike afterhyperpolarization through GJs. This triggers network desynchronization because heterogeneous coupling to surrounding cells causes spike-phase dispersion. Detailed network models predict that desynchronization is robust, local, and dependent on synaptic input properties. Our results show that GJ coupling can be inhibitory and either promote network synchronization or trigger rapid network desynchronization depending on the synaptic input. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

The divergent feedforward networks thought to underlie this computation are widespread, yet exhibit remarkably similar sparse synaptic connectivity. Marr-Albus theory postulates that such networks separate overlapping activity patterns by mapping them onto larger numbers of sparsely active neurons. But spatial correlations in synaptic input and those introduced by network connectivity are likely to compromise performance. To investigate the structural and functional determinants of pattern separation we built models of the cerebellar input layer with spatially correlated input patterns, and systematically varied their synaptic connectivity. Performance was quantified by the learning speed of a classifier trained on either the input or output patterns. Our results show that sparse synaptic connectivity is essential for separating spatially correlated input patterns over a wide range of network activity, and that expansion and correlations, rather than sparse activity, are the major determinants of pattern separation. © 2017 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {To better understand population phenomena in thalamocortical neuronal ensembles, we have constructed a preliminary network model with 3,560 multicompartment neurons (containing soma, branching dendrites, and a portion of axon). Types of neurons included superficial pyramids (with regular spiking [RS] and fast rhythmic bursting [FRB] firing behaviors); RS spiny stellates; fast spiking (FS) interneurons, with basket-type and axoaxonic types of connectivity, and located in superficial and deep cortical layers; low threshold spiking (LTS) interneurons, which contacted principal cell dendrites; deep pyramids, which could have RS or intrinsic bursting (IB) firing behaviors, and endowed either with nontufted apical dendrites or with long tufted apical dendrites: thalamocortical relay (TCR) cells; and nucleus reticularis (nRT) cells. To the extent possible, both electrophysiology and synaptic connectivity were based on published data, although many arbitrary choices were necessary. In addition to synaptic connectivity (by AMPA/kainate, NMDA, and GABAA receptors), we also included electrical coupling between dendrites of interneurons, nRT cells, and TCR cells, and-in various combinations-electrical coupling between the proximal axons of certain cortical principal neurons. Our network model replicates several observed population phenomena, including 1) persistent gamma oscillations; 2) thalamocortical sleep spindles; 3) series of synchronized population bursts, resembling electrographic seizures; 4) isolated double population bursts with superimposed very fast oscillations (\&gt;100 Hz, "VFO"); 5) spike-wave, polyspike-wave, and fast runs (about 10 Hz). We show that epileptiform bursts, including double and multiple bursts, containing VFO occur in rat auditory cortex in vitro, in the presence of kainate, when both GABAA and GABAB receptors are blocked. Electrical coupling between axons appears necessary (as reported previously) for persistent gamma and additionally plays a role in the detailed shaping of epileptogenic events. The degree of recurrent synaptic excitation between spiny stellate cells, and their tendency to fire throughout multiple bursts, also appears critical in shaping epileptogenic events.

Based on this integrated map, we build a full-scale spiking network model of the local cortical microcircuit. The simulated spontaneous activity is asynchronous irregular and cell-type specific firing rates are in agreement with in vivo recordings in awake animals, including the low rate of layer 2/3 excitatory cells. The interplay of excitation and inhibition captures the flow of activity through cortical layers after transient thalamic stimulation.

In neuroscience, data-driven models of neural circuits that span multiple scales are increasingly being used to understand brain function in health and disease. But their adoption and reuse has been limited by the specialist knowledge required to evaluate and use them. To address this, we have developed Open Source Brain, a platform for sharing, viewing, analyzing, and simulating standardized models from different brain regions and species. Model structure and parameters can be automatically visualized and their dynamical properties explored through browser-based simulations. Infrastructure and tools for collaborative interaction, development, and testing are also provided. We demonstrate how existing components can be reused by constructing new models of inhibition-stabilized cortical networks that match recent experimental results. These features of Open Source Brain improve the accessibility, transparency, and reproducibility of models and facilitate their reuse by the wider community.},

	abstract = {Non-invasive brain stimulation methods, such as Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), are widely used worldwide to make causality-based inferences about brain-behavior interactions. TMS-based clinical applications have been shown promising to treat neurological or psychiatric diseases. TMS works by inducing non-invasively electric currents in localized cortical regions thus modulating their excitability levels and ongoing activity patterns depending on stimulation settings: frequency, number of pulses, train duration and intertrain intervals. Proper use of TMS in the fundamental and clinical neuroscience research requires a deep understanding of its operational principles, risks, potential and limitations. In this article we present the principles through which TMS is thought to operate. Readers will be provided with the bases to be able to understand and critically discuss TMS studies and design hypothesis driven TMS applications for basic and clinical neuroscience. Moreover, some recently identified physiological phenomena which that can dramatically influence the efficacy and magnitude of TMS impact and technological and methodological developments to guide TMS interventions that are becoming mainstream in the field will be also reviewed.},

	abstract = {Background Low-level light therapy (LLLT) with transcranial laser is a non-invasive form of neuroenhancement shown to regulate neuronal metabolism and cognition. Attention bias modification (ABM) is a cognitive intervention designed to improve depression by decreasing negative attentional bias, but to date its efficacy has been inconclusive. Adjunctive neuroenhancement to augment clinical effectiveness has shown promise, particularly for individuals who respond positively to the primary intervention. Objective/hypothesis This randomized, sham-controlled proof-of-principle study is the first to test the hypothesis that augmentative LLLT will improve the effects of ABM among adults with elevated symptoms of depression. Methods Fifty-one adult participants with elevated symptoms of depression received ABM before and after laser stimulation and were randomized to one of three conditions: right forehead, left forehead, or sham. Participants repeated LLLT two days later and were assessed for depression symptoms one and two weeks later. Results A significant three-way interaction between LLLT condition, ABM response, and time indicated that right LLLT led to greater symptom improvement among participants whose attention was responsive to ABM (i.e., attention was directed away from negative stimuli). Minimal change in depression was observed in the left and sham LLLT. Conclusions The beneficial effects of ABM on depression symptoms may be enhanced when paired with adjunctive interventions such as right prefrontal LLLT; however, cognitive response to ABM likely moderates the impact of neuroenhancement. The results suggest that larger clinical trials examining the efficacy of using photoneuromodulation to augment cognitive training are warranted.},

	abstract = {Background: Transcranial laser stimulation is a novel method of noninvasive brain stimulation found safe and effective for improving prefrontal cortex neurocognitive functions in healthy young adults. This method is different from electric and magnetic stimulation because it causes the photonic oxidation of cytochrome-c-oxidase, the rate-limiting enzyme for oxygen consumption and the major intracellular acceptor of photons from near-infrared light. This photobiomodulation effect promotes mitochondrial respiration, cerebrovascular oxygenation and neurocognitive function. Pilot studies suggest that transcranial photobiomodulation may also induce beneficial effects in aging individuals. Objectives: Randomized, sham-controlled study to test photobiomodulation effects caused by laser stimulation on cytochrome-c-oxidase oxidation and hemoglobin oxygenation in the prefrontal cortex of 68 healthy younger and older adults, ages 18–85. Methods: Broadband near-infrared spectroscopy was used for the noninvasive quantification of bilateral cortical changes in oxidized cytochrome-c-oxidase and hemoglobin oxygenation before, during and after 1064-nm wavelength laser (IR-A laser, area: 13.6 cm2, power density: 250 mW/cm2) or sham stimulation of the right anterior prefrontal cortex (Brodmann Area 10). Results: As compared to sham control, there was a significant laser-induced increase in oxidized cytochrome-c-oxidase during laser stimulation, followed by a significant post-stimulation increase in oxygenated hemoglobin and a decrease in deoxygenated hemoglobin. Furthermore, there was a greater laser-induced effect on cytochrome-c-oxidase with increasing age, while laser-induced effects on cerebral hemodynamics decreased with increasing age. No adverse laser effects were found. Conclusion: The findings support the use of transcranial photobiomodulation for cerebral oxygenation and alleviation of age-related decline in mitochondrial respiration. They justify further research on its therapeutic potential in neurologic and psychiatric diseases.},

As part of a larger clinical trial concerning the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for treatment-resistant depression, the current study aimed to examine referral emails to describe the clinical characteristics of people who self-refer and explore the reasons for self-referral for TMS treatment. We used content analysis to explore these characteristics and thematic analysis to explore the reasons for self-referral.

Results
Of the 98 referrals, 57 (58\%) were for women. Depressive disorder was the most commonly cited diagnosis, followed by bipolar affective disorder. Six themes emerged from the thematic analysis: treatment resistance, side-effects of other treatments, desperation for relief, proactively seeking information, long-term illness and illness getting worse.

Clinical implications
TMS has recently been recommended in the UK for routine use in clinical practice. Therefore, the number of people who self-refer for TMS treatment is likely to increase as its availability increases.

In this Review, we critically discuss the evidence on the long-term outcomes of DBS and consider the clinical implications. Although many patients are lost to follow-up, the evidence indicates that subthalamic nucleus DBS improves motor function for up to 10 years, although the magnitude of improvement tends to decline over time. Functional scores recorded during on-medication periods worsen more quickly than those recorded in off periods, consistent with the degeneration of non-dopaminergic pathways. Dyskinesia, motor fluctuations and activities of daily living in off periods remain improved at 5 years, but quality-of-life scores have usually fallen below preoperative levels. The incidence and severity of dementia among patients receiving DBS are comparable to those among patients who receive medical treatment. Severe adverse events are rare, but adverse events such as dysarthria are common and probably under-reported. Long-term data on the outcomes of globus pallidus interna DBS are limited and mostly confirm the efficacy for dyskinesia. A trend towards offering DBS in the earlier stages of PD creates a need to identify factors that predict long-term outcomes and to discuss realistic expectations with patients preoperatively.},

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative illness with both motor and nonmotor symptoms. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established safe neurosurgical symptomatic therapy for eligible patients with advanced disease in whom medical treatment fails to provide adequate symptom control and good quality of life, or in whom dopaminergic medications induce severe side effects such as dyskinesias. DBS can be tailored to the patient's symptoms and targeted to various nodes along the basal ganglia–thalamus circuitry, which mediates the various symptoms of the illness; DBS in the thalamus is most efficient for tremors, and DBS in the pallidum most efficient for rigidity and dyskinesias, whereas DBS in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) can treat both tremors, akinesia, rigidity and dyskinesias, and allows for decrease in doses of medications even in patients with advanced stages of the disease, which makes it the preferred target for DBS. However, DBS in the STN assumes that the patient is not too old, with no cognitive decline or relevant depression, and does not exhibit severe and medically resistant axial symptoms such as balance and gait disturbances, and falls. Dysarthria is the most common side effect of DBS, regardless of the brain target. DBS has a long‐lasting effect on appendicular symptoms, but with progression of disease, nondopaminergic axial features become less responsive to DBS. DBS for PD is highly specialised; to enable adequate selection and follow‐up of patients, DBS requires dedicated multidisciplinary teams of movement disorder neurologists, functional neurosurgeons, specialised DBS nurses and neuropsychologists.,},

We call this a “non-open” network topology. An “open” topology, where at least one neuron does not receive synapses from any other CPG member, is found neither in the pyloric nor in the gastric mill CPG. Here we investigate a possible reason for this topological structure using the ability to perform a biologically functional task as a measure of the efficacy of the network. When the CPG is composed of model neurons that exhibit regular membrane voltage oscillations, open topologies are as able to maximize this functionality as non-open topologies. When we replace these models by neurons which exhibit chaotic membrane voltage oscillations, the functional criterion selects non-open topologies. As isolated neurons from invertebrate CPGs are known in some cases to undergo chaotic oscillations, this suggests that there is a biological basis for the class of non-open network topologies that we observe.},

Electrophysiological and video recording methods were used to investigate the function of lip touch in feeding ingestion behavior of the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. Although this stimulus was used successfully as a conditioning stimulus (CS) in appetitive learning experiments, the detailed role of lip touch as a component of the sensory stimulus provided by food in unconditioned feeding behavior was never ascertained. Synaptic responses to lip touch in identified feeding motoneurons, central pattern generator interneurons, and modulatory interneurons were recorded by intracellular electrodes in a semi-intact preparation. We showed that touch evoked a complex but characteristic sequence of synaptic inputs on each neuron type. Touch never simply activated feeding cycles but provided different types of synaptic input, determined by the feeding phase in which the neuron was normally active in the rhythmic feeding cycle. The tactile stimulus evoked mainly inhibitory synaptic inputs in protraction-phase neurons and excitation in rasp-phase neurons. Swallow-phase neurons were also excited after some delay, suggesting that touch first reinforces the rasp then swallow phase. Video analysis of freely feeding animals demonstrated that during normal ingestion of a solid food flake the food is drawn across the lips throughout the rasp phase and swallow phase and therefore provides a tactile stimulus during both these retraction phases of the feeding cycle. The tactile component of the food stimulus is strongest during the rasp phase when the lips are actively pressed onto the substrate that is being moved across them by the radula. By using a semi-intact preparation we demonstrated that application of touch to the lips during the rasp phase of a sucrose-driven fictive feeding rhythm increases both the regularity and frequency of rasp-phase motoneuron firing compared with sucrose applied alone.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater},

	abstract = {Dopamine activates two different receptors to produce variability in sign at an identified synapse. Chemical synaptic transmission was investigated at a central synapse between identified neurons in the freshwater snail, Lymnaea stagnalis. The presynaptic neuron was the dopaminergic cell, Right Pedal Dorsal one (RPeD1). The postsynaptic neuron was Visceral Dorsal four (VD4). These neurons are components of the respiratory central pattern generator. The synapse from RPeD1 to VD4 showed variability of sign, i.e., it was either inhibitory (monophasic and hyperpolarizing), biphasic (depolarizing followed by hyperpolarizing phases), or undetectable. Both the inhibitory and biphasic synapse were eliminated by low Ca 2+ /high Mg 2+ saline and maintained in high Ca 2+ /high Mg 2+ saline, indicating that these two types of connections were chemical and monosynaptic. The latency of the inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) in high Ca 2+ /high Mg 2+ saline was ∼43 ms, whereas the biphasic postsynaptic potential (BPSP) had ∼12-ms latency in either normal or high Ca 2+ /high Mg 2+ saline. For a given preparation, when dopamine was pressured applied to the soma of VD4, it always elicited the same response as the synaptic input from RPeD1. Thus, for a VD4 neuron receiving an IPSP from RPeD1, pressure application of dopamine to the soma of VD4 produced an inhibitory response similar to the IPSP. The reversal potentials of the IPSP and the inhibitory dopamine response were both approximately −90 mV. For a VD4 neuron with a biphasic input from RPeD1, pressure-applied dopamine produced a biphasic response similar to the BPSP. The reversal potentials of the depolarizing phase of the BPSP and the biphasic dopamine response were both approximately −44 mV, whereas the reversal potentials for the hyperpolarizing phases were both approximately −90 mV. The hyperpolarizing but not the depolarizing phase of the BPSP and the biphasic dopamine response was blocked by the d-2 dopaminergic antagonist (±) sulpiride. Previously, our laboratory demonstrated that both IPSP and the inhibitory dopamine response are blocked by (±) sulpiride. Conversely, the depolarizing phase of both the BPSP and the biphasic dopamine response was blocked by the Cl − channel antagonist picrotoxin. Finally, both phases of the BPSP and the biphasic dopamine response were desensitized by continuous bath application of dopamine. These results indicate that the biphasic RPeD1 → VD4 synapse is dopaminergic. Collectively, these data suggest that the variability in sign (inhibitory vs. biphasic) at the RPeD1 → VD4 synapse is due to activation of two different dopamine receptors on the postsynaptic neuron VD4. This demonstrates that two populations of receptors can produce two different forms of transmission, i.e., the inhibitory and biphasic forms of the single RPeD1 → VD4 synapse.},

We show that the oscillation period of invertebrate endogenous pacemaker neurons wanders, producing random fluctuations in the interspike intervals (ISI) on a time scale of seconds to minutes, which decorrelates pairs of neurons in hybrid circuits constructed using the dynamic clamp. The autocorrelation of the ISI sequence remained high for many ISIs, but the autocorrelation of the ΔISI series had on average a single nonzero value, which was negative at a lag of one interval. We reproduced these results using a simple integrate and fire (IF) model with a stochastic population of channels carrying an adaptation current with a stochastic component that was integrated with a slow time scale, suggesting that a similar population of channels underlies the observed wander in the period. Using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, we found that a single integrator and a single moving average with a negative coefficient could simulate both the experimental data and the IF model. Feeding white noise into an integrator with a slow time constant is sufficient to produce the autocorrelation structure of the ISI series. Moreover, the moving average clearly accounted for the autocorrelation structure of the ΔISI series and is biophysically implemented in the IF model using slow stochastic adaptation. The observed autocorrelation structure may be a neural signature of slow stochastic adaptation, and wander generated in this manner may be a general mechanism for limiting episodes of synchronized activity in the nervous system.},

The period of the gastric rhythm is typically 5-10 s, whereas the period of the pyloric rhythm is approximately 1 s. 2. In the STG of the crab, Cancer borealis, we find routinely that many motor neurons are active in time with both the pyloric and gastric rhythms. We rigorously identified the motor neurons according to the muscles they innervate. Some neurons usually classified as members of the pyloric network can be active in time with the gastric rhythm. All of the gastric motor neurons except the dorsal gastric (DG) neuron can generate pyloric-timed firing patterns. 3. Two motor neurons innervate muscles found in several different regions of the stomach. The inferior cardiac (IC) neuron, usually considered part of the pyloric network, innervates cardiac sac, gastric mill, and pyloric muscles. The lateral posterior gastric (LPG) neurons innervate muscles of both the gastric mill and the pyloric chamber. 4. These data show that the gastric and pyloric networks in the crab are not separate groups of neurons that independently generate two different rhythmic behaviors. Rather, these neurons together provide a synaptically connected pool of neurons from which many different pattern-generating circuits can be assembled, under different physiological conditions.},

Up until now, these effects have been shown in rodents and humans only. Little is known about their evolutionary origin or biological basis, and the underlying cellular mechanisms also remain relatively elusive. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that preceding motor activity accelerates decision making in an invertebrate, the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. To investigate decision making in a novel environment, snails, which normally live in water, were placed on a flat dry surface to simulate the potentially threatening consequence of being in an arid environment. This stimulus initiated two distinct phases in snail behaviour: slow circular movements, followed by intense locomotion in a chosen direction. The first phase was prolonged when the test arena was symmetrically lit, compared with one with an apparent gradient of light. However, forced muscular locomotion for 2 h prior to the test promoted the transition from random circular motions to a directional crawl, accompanied by an increase in crawling speed but with no effect on the choice of direction. Intense locomotion for 2 h also produced a strong excitatory effect on the activity of serotonergic neurons in L. stagnalis. Our results suggest that the beneficial effects of physical exercise on cognitive performance in mammals might have deep roots in evolution, granting the opportunity to unravel the origins of such effects at the single-neuron and network levels.},

The model includes a slow-wave generating mechanism, a spike-generating mechanism, an inward Ca current, intracellular Ca ions, [Ca2+](im), their fast buffering and uptake by intracellular Ca stores, and a [Ca2+](im)-inhibited Ca current. Chemosensitive voltage-activated conductance, g(B)(*) responsible for termination of the spike burst, and chemosensitive sodium conductance, g(Na)(*), responsible for the depolarizing phase of the slow-wave, were used as control parameters. These conductances in intact snail bursting neuron are regulated by neuropeptides. Time courses of the membrane potential and [Ca2+](in) were employed to analyse different regimes in the model. Histograms of interspike intervals, autocorrelograms, spectral characteristics, one-dimensional return maps, phase plane trajectories, positive Lyapunov exponent and especially cascades of period-doubling bifurcations demonstrate that approaches to chaos were generated. The bifurcation diagram as a function of g(B)(*) and the ([Ca2+](in)-V) phase diagram of initial conditions reveal fractal features. It has been observed that a short-lasting depolarizing current or elevation of [Ca2+](in) may evoke transformation of chaotic activity into a regular bursting one. These kinds of transitions do not require any changes in the parameters of the model. The results demonstrate that chaotic regimes of neuronal activity modulated by neuropeptides may play a relevant role in information processing and storage at the level of a single neuron.},

We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information.

We test the hypothesis that it inhibits neurons at all levels of the feeding system, using a combination of anatomy, physiology and pharmacology. There is just one PlB in each pleural ganglion. Its axon traverses the pedal and cerebral ganglia, running into the buccal ganglia. It has neuropilar branches in the regions of the cerebral and buccal ganglia where neurons that are active during feeding also branch. Activation of the PlB blocks fictive feeding, whether the feeding rhythm occurs spontaneously or is driven by a modulatory interneuron. The PlB inhibits all the neurons in the feeding network, including protraction and retraction motoneurons, central pattern generator interneurons, buccal modulatory interneurons (SO, OC), and cerebral modulatory interneurons (CV1, CGC). Only the CV1 interneuron shows discrete 1:1 IPSPs; all other effects are slow, smooth hyperpolarizations. All connections persist in Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ -rich saline, which reduces polysynaptic effects. The inhibitory effects are mimicked by 0.5 to 100 μmoll -1 FMRFamide, which the PlB soma contains. We conclude that the PlB inhibits neurons in the feeding system at all levels, probably acting though the peptide transmitter FMRFamide. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

Understanding central pattern generator (CPG) circuits requires a detailed knowledge of the intrinsic cellular properties of the constituent neurons. These properties are poorly understood in most CPGs because of the complexity resulting from interactions with other neurons of the circuit. This is also the case in the feeding network of the snail, Lymnaea, one of the best-characterized CPG networks. We addressed this problem by isolating the interneurons comprising the feeding CPG in cell culture, which enabled us to study their basic intrinsic electrical and pharmacological cellular properties without interference from other network components. These results were then related to the activity patterns of the neurons in the intact feeding network. The most striking finding was the intrinsic generation of plateau potentials by medial N1 (N1M) interneurons. This property is probably critical for rhythm generation in the whole feeding circuit because the N1M interneurons are known to play a pivotal role in the initiation of feeding cycles in response to food. Plateau potential generation in another cell type, the ventral N2 (N2v), appeared to be conditional on the presence of acetylcholine. Examination of the other isolated feeding CPG interneurons [lateral N1 (N1L), dorsal N2 (N2d), phasic N3 (N3p)] and the modulatory slow oscillator (SO) revealed no significant intrinsic properties in relation to pattern generation. Instead, their firing patterns in the circuit appear to be determined largely by cholinergic and glutama-tergic synaptic inputs from other CPG interneurons, which were mimicked in culture by application of these transmitters. This is an example of a CPG system where the initiation of each cycle appears to be determined by the intrinsic properties of a key interneuron, N1M, but most other features of the rhythm are probably determined by network interactions.},

	abstract = {In vitro neuronal cultures exhibit spontaneous electrophysiological activity that can be modulated by chemical stimulation and can be monitored over time by using Micro-Electrode Arrays (MEAs), devices composed by a glass substrate and metal electrodes. Dissociated networks respond to transmitters, their blockers and many other pharmacological substances, including neurotoxic compounds. In this paper we present results related to the effects, both acute (i.e. 1. hour after the treatment) and chronic (3. days after the treatment), of increasing glutamatergic transmission induced by the application of rising concentrations of glutamate and its agonists (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid - AMPA, N-methyl-D-aspartate - NMDA and AMPA together with cyclothiazide - CTZ). Increase of available glutamate was obtained in two ways: 1) by direct application of exogenous glutamate and 2) by inhibiting the clearance of the endogenously released glutamate through DL-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartate (TBOA). Our findings show that fine modulations (i.e. low concentrations of drug) of the excitatory synaptic transmission are reflected in the electrophysiological activation of the network, while intervention leading to excessive direct stimulation of glutamatergic pathways (i.e. medium and high concentrations of drug) results in the abolishment of the electrophysiological activity and eventually cell death. The results obtained by means of the MEA recordings have been compared to the analysis of cell viability to confirm the excitotoxic effect of the applied drug. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that MEA-coupled cortical networks are very sensitive to pharmacological manipulation of the excitatory ionotropic glutamatergic transmission and might provide sensitive endpoints to detect acute and chronic neurotoxic effects of chemicals and drugs for predictive toxicity testing. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

CV1 interneurones produced facilitating excitatory postsynaptic potentials in N1 interneurones of the buccal central pattern generator for feeding. Connections with N2 interneurones were not found. 3. The CV1 population could be separated into two subgroups. CV1a received strong synaptic feedback in phase with the buccal rhythm, leading to strong bursting during generation of feeding motor output. CV1b received only weak feedback, and often fired continuously when depolarized. 4. Unitary inhibitory postsynaptic potentials were characteristic of all CV1 neurones, but were only visible in CV1b when it was depolarized. These inputs are thought to arise indirectly from the buccal central pattern generator. 5. The CV1 population is probably homologous with similar neurones in other gastropod species},

In the cerebral giant cells of Lymnaea, a transient inward Na+ current was identified with activation at -58 ± 2 mV. It was sensitive to tetrodotoxin only in high concentrations (≈ 50\% block at 100 μM), a characteristic of Na+ channels in many molluscan neurons. A much smaller low-threshold persistent Na+ current (activation at {\textbackslash}textless-90 mV) was also identified. Two purely voltage-sensitive outward K+ currents were also found: (i) a transient A-current type which was activated at -59 ± 4 mV and blocked by 4-aminopyridine; (ii) a sustained tetraethylammonium-sensitive delayed rectifier current which was activated at -47 ± 2 mV. There was also evidence that a third, Ca2+-activated, K+ channel made a contribution to the total outward current. No inwardly rectifying currents were found. Two Ca2+ currents were characterized: (i) a transient low-voltage (-65 ± 2 mV) activated T-type current, which was blocked in NiCl2 (2 mM) and was completely inactivated at ≈-50 mV; (ii) A sustained high voltage (-40 ± 1 mV) activated current, which was blocked in CdCl2 (100 μM) but not in ømega-conotoxin GVIA (10 μM), ømega-agatoxin IVA (500 nM) or nifedipine (10 μM). This current was enhanced in Ba2+ saline. Current-clamp experiments revealed how these different current types could define the membrane potential and firing properties of the cerebral giant cells, which are important in shaping the wide-acting modulatory influence of this neuron on the rest of the feeding network.},

Here we explored the possibility that the physiological diversity of mossy fiber (MF) to granule cell (GC) synapses in the mouse vestibulocerebellum may contribute to the processing of coincident multisensory information at the level of individual GCs. We found that the strength and short-term dynamics of individual MF-GC synapses can act as biophysical signatures for primary vestibular, secondary vestibular and visual input pathways. Most GCs receive inputs from different modalities, which, when coactivated, produced enhanced GC firing rates and distinct first spike latencies. Thus, pathway-specific synaptic response properties permit temporal coding of correlated multisensory inputs by single GCs, thereby enriching sensory representation and facilitating pattern separation.},

	abstract = {Electrically coupled neurons communicate through channel assemblies called gap junctions, which mediate the transfer of current from one cell to another. Electrical synapses ensure spike synchronization and reliable transmission, which influences bursting patterns and firing frequency. The present study concerns an electrically coupled two-neuron network in the gastropod mollusc, Lymnaea stagnalis. The neurons, designated Visceral Dorsal 1 (VD1) and Right Parietal Dorsal 2 (RPD2), are peptidergic, innervate aspects of the cardio-respiratory system, and show strong coupling, such that they fire synchronously. Using dual sharp-electrode current-clamp recording and morphological staining in isolated brain preparations, the hypothesis that the electrical synapse is necessary for accurate network output was tested. We found that both cells make extensive projections within and out of the brain, including across the visceral-parietal connective, which links VD1 and RPD2. Cutting this connective uncoupled the neurons and disrupted the firing rate and pattern of RPD2 more than VD1, consistent with VD1 being the master and RPD2 the follower. The electrical synapse was inhibited by select gap junction blockers, with niflumic acid and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid decreasing the VD1→RPD2 and RPD2→VD1 coupling coefficients, whereas carbenoxolone, α-glycyrrhetinic acid, meclofenamic acid, and quinine were ineffective. There was little-to-no impact on VD1 虠 RPD2 firing synchrony or frequency when coupling was reduced pharmacologically. However, in the presence of gap junction blockers, suppressing the activity of VD1 by prolonged hyperpolarization revealed a distinct, low-frequency firing pattern in RPD2. This suggests that strong electrical coupling is key to maintaining a synchronous output and proper firing rate.},

The most frequent patterns were left and right posterior-temporal delta brushes which were associated in the left hemisphere with ipsilateral BOLD activation in the insula only; and in the right hemisphere in both the insular and temporal cortices. This direct measure of neural and hemodynamic activity shows that the insula, one of the most densely connected hubs in the developing cortex, is a major source of the transient bursting events that are critical for brain maturation.},

	abstract = {Sensory input plays a major role in controlling motor responses during most behavioral tasks. The vestibular organs in the marine mollusk Clione, the statocysts, react to the external environment and continuously adjust the tail and wing motor neurons to keep the animal oriented vertically. However, we suggested previously that during hunting behavior, the intrinsic dynamics of the statocyst network produce a spatiotemporal pattern that may control the motor system independently of environmental cues. Once the response is triggered externally, the collective activation of the statocyst neurons produces a complex sequential signal. In the behavioral context of hunting, such network dynamics may be the main determinant of an intricate spatial behavior. Here, we show that (1) during fictive hunting, the population activity of the statocyst receptors is correlated positively with wing and tail motor output suggesting causality, (2) that fictive hunting can be evoked by electrical stimulation of the statocyst network, and (3) that removal of even a few individual statocyst receptors critically changes the fictive hunting motor pattern. These results indicate that the intrinsic dynamics of a sensory network, even without its normal cues, can organize a motor program vital for the survival of the animal.},

	abstract = {One contribution of 16 to a discussion meeting issue 'Homology and convergence in nervous system evolution'. Comparisons of rhythmic movements and the central pattern generators (CPGs) that control them uncover principles about the evolution of behaviour and neural circuits. Over the course of evolutionary history, gradual evolution of behaviours and their neural circuitry within any lineage of animals has been a predominant occurrence. Small changes in gene regulation can lead to divergence of circuit organization and corresponding changes in behaviour. However, some behavioural divergence has resulted from large-scale rewiring of the neural network. Divergence of CPG circuits has also occurred without a corresponding change in behaviour. When analogous rhythmic behaviours have evolved independently, it has generally been with different neural mechanisms. Repeated evolution of particular rhythmic behaviours has occurred within some lineages due to parallel evolution or latent CPGs. Particular motor pattern generating mechanisms have also evolved independently in separate lineages. The evolution of CPGs and rhythmic behaviours shows that although most behaviours and neural circuits are highly conserved, the nature of the behaviour does not dictate the neural mechanism and that the presence of homologous neural components does not determine the behaviour. This suggests that although behaviour is generated by neural circuits, natural selection can act separately on these two levels of biological organization.},

In this chapter we review some of the most popular models of neurons and neural networks that help us understand how living systems perform information processing. Beyond the fundamental goal of understanding the function of the nervous system, the lessons learned from these models can also be used to build bio-inspired paradigms of artificial intelligence and robotics.},

	abstract = {An essential question raised after the observation of highly variable bursting activity in individual neurons of Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) is how an assembly of such cells can cooperatively act to produce regular signals to motor systems. It is well known that some neurons in the lobster stomatogastric ganglion have a highly irregular spiking-bursting behavior when they are synaptically isolated from any connection in the CPG. Experimental recordings show that periodic stimuli on a single neuron can regulate its firing activity. Other evidence demonstrates that specific chemical and/or electrical synapses among neurons also induce the regularization of the rhythms. In this paper we present a modeling study in which a slow subcellular dynamics, the exchange of calcium between an intracellular store and the cytoplasm, is responsible for the origin and control of the irregular spiking-bursting activity. We show this in simulations of single cells under periodic driving and in minimal networks where the cooperative activity can induce regularization. While often neglected in the description of realistic neuron models, subcellular processes with slow dynamics may play an important role in information processing and short-term memory of spiking-bursting neurons. ©2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {Conductance-based models of neurons from the lobster stomatogastric ganglion (STG) have been developed to understand the observed chaotic behavior of individual STG neurons. These models identify an additional slow dynamical process - calcium exchange and storage in the endoplasmic reticulum - as a biologically plausible source for the observed chaos in the oscillations of these cells. In this paper we test these ideas further by exploring the dynamical behavior when two model neurons are coupled by electrical or gap junction connections. We compare in detail the model results to the laboratory measurements of electrically-coupled neurons that we reported earlier. The experiments on the biological neurons varied the strength of the effective coupling by applying a parallel, artificial synapse, which changed both the magnitude and polarity of the conductance between the neurons. We observed a sequence of bifurcations that took the neurons from strongly synchronized in-phase behavior, through uncorrelated chaotic oscillations to strongly synchronized - and now regular - out-of-phase behavior. The model calculations reproduce these observations quantitatively, indicating that slow subcellular processes could account for the mechanisms involved in the synchronization and regularization of the otherwise individual chaotic activities.},

	abstract = {There are many types of neural networks involved in the sequential motor behavior of animals. For high species, the control and coordination of the network dynamics is a function of the higher levels of the central nervous system, in particular the cerebellum. However, in many cases, especially for invertebrates, such coordination is the result of direct synaptic connections between small circuits. We show here that even the chaotic sequential activity of small model networks can be coordinated by electrotonic synapses connecting one or several pairs of neurons that belong to two different networks. As an example, we analyzed the coordination and synchronization of the sequential activity of two statocyst model networks of the marine mollusk Clione. The statocysts are gravity sensory organs that play a key role in postural control of the animal and the generation of a complex hunting motor program. Each statocyst network was modeled by a small ensemble of neurons with Lotka-Volterra type dynamics and nonsymmetric inhibitory interactions. We studied how two such networks were synchronized by electrical coupling in the presence of an external signal which lead to winnerless competition among the neurons. We found that as a function of the number and the strength of connections between the two networks, it is possible to coordinate and synchronize the sequences that each network generates with its own chaotic dynamics. In spite of the chaoticity, the coordination of the signals is established through an activation sequence lock for those neurons that are active at a particular instant of time.},

	abstract = {Recent experimental findings have shown the presence of robust and cell- type-specific intraburst firing patterns in bursting neurons. We address the problem of characterizing these patterns under the assumption that the bursts exhibit well-defined firing time distributions. We propose a method for estimating these distributions based on a burst alignment al- gorithm that minimizes the overlap among the firing time distributions of the different spikes within the burst. This method provides a good approximation to the burst's intrinsic temporal structure as a set of firing time distributions. In addition, the method allows labeling the spikes in any particular burst, establishing a correspondence between each spike and the distribution that best explains it, and identifying missing spikes. Our results on both simulated and experimental data from the lobster stomatogastric ganglion show that the proposed method provides a re- liable characterization of the intraburst firing patterns and avoids the errors derived from missing spikes. This method can also be applied to nonbursting neurons as a general tool for the study and the interpretation of firing time distributions as part of a temporal neural code. ©2008 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

Many central pattern generators (CPGs) are built on a basic circuit of reciprocally inhibitory neurons, the minimal configuration that can produce distinct rhythmic patterns for controlling antagonistic muscles. In this paper, we use a closed-loop to control the rhythm of a CPG model based on this minimal network architecture. The closed-loop adapts the maximum conductance of the inhibition to achieve a regularized rhythm departing from an otherwise highly irregular spiking-bursting activity. Our results show that the closed-loop conductance control can rapidly find the best connectivity that leads to the regularization goal. We also discuss several external stimuli that lead to regularized CPG rhythms. We argue that the proposed closed-loop approach can be used to control CPG rhythms in a wide variety of applications in experimental and theoretical research.},

In particular, we illustrate three different examples of goal-driven real-time closed-loop interactions with drug microinjectors, mechanical devices and video event driven stimulation. Modern activity-dependent stimulation protocols can be used to reveal dynamics (otherwise hidden under traditional stimulation techniques), achieve control of natural and pathological states, induce learning, bridge between disparate levels of analysis and for a further automation of experiments.

	abstract = {The inferior olive (IO) is a neural network belonging to the olivo-cerebellar system whose neurons are coupled with electrical synapses and display subthreshold oscillations and spiking activity. The IO is frequently proposed as the generator of timing signals to the cerebellum. Electrophysiological and imaging recordings show that the IO network generates complex spatio-temporal patterns. The generation and modulation of coherent spiking activity in the IO is one key issue in cerebellar research. In this work, we build a large scale IO network model of electrically coupled conductance-based neurons to study the emerging spatio-temporal patterns of its transient neuronal activity. Our modeling reproduces and helps to understand important phenomena observed in IO in vitro and in vivo experiments, and draws new predictions regarding the computational properties of this network and the associated cerebellar circuits. The main factors studied governing the collective dynamics of the IO network were: the degree of electrical coupling, the extent of the electrotonic connections, the presence of stimuli or regions with different excitability levels and the modulatory effect of an inhibitory loop (IL). The spatio-temporal patterns were analyzed using a discrete wavelet transform to provide a quantitative characterization. Our results show that the electrotonic coupling produces quasi-synchronized subthreshold oscillations over a wide dynamical range. The synchronized oscillatory activity plays the role of a timer for a coordinated representation of spiking rhythms with different frequencies. The encoding and coexistence of several coordinated rhythms is related to the different clusterization and coherence of transient spatio-temporal patterns in the network, where the spiking activity is commensurate with the quasi-synchronized subthreshold oscillations. In the presence of stimuli, different rhythms are encoded in the spiking activity of the IO neurons that nevertheless remains constrained to a commensurate value of the subthreshold frequency. The stimuli induced spatio-temporal patterns can reverberate for long periods, which contributes to the computational properties of the IO. We also show that the presence of regions with different excitability levels creates sinks and sources of coordinated activity which shape the propagation of spike wave fronts. These results can be generalized beyond IO studies, as the control of wave pattern propagation is a highly relevant problem in the context of normal and pathological states in neural systems (e.g., related to tremor, migraine, epilepsy) where the study of the modulation of activity sinks and sources can have a potential large impact.},

The model describes the coordination of spatio-temporal patterns in the form of sequential switchings corresponding to different modalities. We formulate the conditions for the existence of a multimodality heteroclinic sequence (MHS) in the phase space of this model.

	abstract = {Dynamical modeling of neural systems and brain functions has a hist ory of success over the last half century. This includes, for example, the explanation and prediction of some features of neural rhythmic behaviors. Many interesting dynamical models of learning and memory based on physiological experiments have been suggested over the last two decades. Dynamical models even of consciousness now exist. Usually these models and results are based on traditional approaches and paradigms of nonlinear dynamics including dynamical chaos. Neural systems are, however, an unusual subject for nonlinear dynamics for several reasons: (i) Even the simplest neural network, with only a few neurons and synaptic connections, has an enormous number of variables and control parameters. These make neural systems adaptive and flexible, and are critical to their biological function. (ii) In contrast to traditional physical systems described by well-known basic principles, first principles governing the dynamics of neural systems are unknown. (iii) Many different neural systems exhibit similar dynamics despite having different architectures and different levels of complexity. (iv) The network architecture and connection strengths are usually not known in detail and therefore the dynamical analysis must, in some sense, be probabilistic. (v) Since nervous systems are able to organize behavior based on sensory inputs, the dynamical modeling of these systems has to explain the transformation of temporal information into combinatorial or combinatorial-temporal codes, and vice versa, for memory and recognition. In this review these problems are discussed in the context of addressing the stimulating questions: What can neuroscience learn from nonlinear dynamics, and what can nonlinear dynamics learn from neuroscience?},

	abstract = {Dynamic clamp is a powerful approach for electrophysiological investigations allowing researchers to introduce artificial electrical components into target neurons to simulate ionic conductances, chemical or electrotonic inputs or connections to other cells. Due to the rapidly changing and potentially large current injections during dynamic clamp, problematic voltage artifacts appear on the electrode used to inject dynamic clamp currents into a target neuron. Dynamic clamp experiments, therefore, typically use two separate electrodes in the same cell, one for recording membrane potential and one for injecting currents. The requirement for two independent electrodes has been a limiting factor for the use of dynamic clamp in applications where dual recordings of this kind are difficult or impossible to achieve. The recent development of an active electrode compensation (AEC) method has overcome some of these prior limitations, permitting artifact-free dynamic clamp experimentation with a single electrode. Here we describe an AEC method for the free dynamic clamp software StdpC. The AEC component of StdpC is the first such system implemented for the use of non-expert users and comes with a set of semi-automated configuration and calibration procedures that facilitate its use. We briefly introduce the AEC method and its implementation in StdpC and then validate it with an electronic model cell and in two different biological preparations.},

	abstract = {In this primer, we give a review of the inverse problem for EEG source localization. This is intended for the researchers new in the field to get insight in the state-of-the-art techniques used to find approximate solutions of the brain sources giving rise to a scalp potential recording. Furthermore, a review of the performance results of the different techniques is provided to compare these different inverse solutions. The authors also include the results of a Monte-Carlo analysis which they performed to compare four non parametric algorithms and hence contribute to what is presently recorded in the literature. An extensive list of references to the work of other researchers is also provided. This paper starts off with a mathematical description of the inverse problem and proceeds to discuss the two main categories of methods which were developed to solve the EEG inverse problem, mainly the non parametric and parametric methods. The main difference between the two is to whether a fixed number of dipoles is assumed a priori or not. Various techniques falling within these categories are described including minimum norm estimates and their generalizations, LORETA, sLORETA, VARETA, S-MAP, ST-MAP, Backus-Gilbert, LAURA, Shrinking LORETA FOCUSS (SLF), SSLOFO and ALF for non parametric methods and beamforming techniques, BESA, subspace techniques such as MUSIC and methods derived from it, FINES, simulated annealing and computational intelligence algorithms for parametric methods. From a review of the performance of these techniques as documented in the literature, one could conclude that in most cases the LORETA solution gives satisfactory results. In situations involving clusters of dipoles, higher resolution algorithms such as MUSIC or FINES are however preferred. Imposing reliable biophysical and psychological constraints, as done by LAURA has given superior results. The Monte-Carlo analysis performed, comparing WMN, LORETA, sLORETA and SLF, for different noise levels and different simulated source depths has shown that for single source localization, regularized sLORETA gives the best solution in terms of both localization error and ghost sources. Furthermore the computationally intensive solution given by SLF was not found to give any additional benefits under such simulated conditions.},

We call this a "non-open" network topology. An "open" topology, where at least one neuron does not receive synapses from any other CPG member, is found neither in the pyloric nor in the gastric mill CPG. Here we investigate a possible reason for this topological structure using the ability to perform a biologically functional task as a measure of the efficacy of the network. When the CPG is composed of model neurons that exhibit regular membrane voltage oscillations, open topologies are as able to maximize this functionality as non-open topologies. When we replace these models by neurons which exhibit chaotic membrane voltage oscillations, the functional criterion selects non-open topologies. As isolated neurons from invertebrate CPGs are known in some cases to undergo chaotic oscillations, this suggests that there is a biological basis for the class of non-open network topologies that we observe.},

In this paper we consider recently revealed strategies that living CPGs follow to design CPG control paradigms for modular robots. To illustrate them, we divide the task of designing an example CPG for a modular robot into independent problems. We formulate each problem in a general way and provide a bio-inspired solution for each of them: locomotion information coding, individual module control and inter-module coordination. We analyse the stability of the CPG numerically, and then test it on a real robot. We analyse steady state locomotion and recovery after perturbations. In both cases, the robot is able to autonomously find a stable effective locomotion state. Finally, we discuss how these strategies can result in a more general design approach for CPG-based locomotion.},

	abstract = {The brain's decoding of fast sensory streams is currently impossible to emulate, even approximately, with artificial agents. For example, robust speech recognition is relatively easy for humans but exceptionally difficult for artificial speech recognition systems. In this paper, we propose that recognition can be simplified with an internal model of how sensory input is generated, when formulated in a Bayesian framework. We show that a plausible candidate for an internal or generative model is a hierarchy of 'stable heteroclinic channels'. This model describes continuous dynamics in the environment as a hierarchy of sequences, where slower sequences cause faster sequences. Under this model, online recognition corresponds to the dynamic decoding of causal sequences, giving a representation of the environment with predictive power on several timescales. We illustrate the ensuing decoding or recognition scheme using synthetic sequences of syllables, where syllables are sequences of phonemes and phonemes are sequences of sound-wave modulations. By presenting anomalous stimuli, we find that the resulting recognition dynamics disclose inference at multiple time scales and are reminiscent of neuronal dynamics seen in the real brain.},

Traditional studies on the interaction of cognitive functions in healthy and disordered brains have used the analyses of the connectivity of several specialized brain networks—the functional connectome. However, emerging evidence suggests that both brain networks and functional spontaneous brain-wide network communication are intrinsically dynamic. In the light of studies investigating the cooperation between different cognitive functions, we consider here the dynamics of hierarchical networks in cognitive space. We show, using an example of behavioural decision-making based on sequential episodic memory, how the description of metastable pattern dynamics underlying basic cognitive processes helps to understand and predict complex processes like sequential episodic memory recall and competition among decision strategies. The mathematical images of the discussed phenomena in the phase space of the corresponding cognitive model are hierarchical heteroclinic networks. One of the most important features of such networks is the robustness of their dynamics. Different kinds of instabilities of these dynamics can be related to ‘dynamical signatures' of creativity and different psychiatric disorders. The suggested approach can also be useful for the understanding of the dynamical processes that are the basis of consciousness.},

	abstract = {Recent experiments have revealed the existence of neural signatures in the activity of individual cells of the pyloric central pattern generator (CPG) of crustacean. The neural signatures consist of cell-specific spike timings in the bursting activity of the neurons. The role of these intraburst neural fingerprints is still unclear. It has been reported previously that some muscles can reflect small changes in the spike timings of the neurons that innervate them. However, it is unclear to what extent neural signatures contribute to the command message that the muscles receive from the motoneurons. It is also unknown whether the signatures have any functional meaning for the neurons that belong to the same CPG or to other interconnected CPGs. In this paper, we use realistic neural models to study the ability of single cells and small circuits to recognize individual neural signatures. We show that model cells and circuits can respond distinctly to the incoming neural fingerprints in addition to the properties of the slow depolarizing waves. Our results suggest that neural signatures can be a general mechanism of spiking-bursting cells to implement multicoding.},

	abstract = {Neurons react differently to incoming stimuli depending upon their previous history of stimulation. This property can be considered as a single-cell substrate for transient memory, or context-dependent information processing: depending upon the current context that the neuron "sees" through the subset of the network impinging on it in the immediate past, the same synaptic event can evoke a postsynaptic spike or just a subthreshold depolarization. We propose a formal definition of History-Dependent Excitability (HDE) as a measure of the propensity to firing in any moment in time, linking the subthreshold history-dependent dynamics with spike generation. This definition allows the quantitative assessment of the intrinsic memory for different single-neuron dynamics and input statistics. We illustrate the concept of HDE by considering two general dynamical mechanisms: the passive behavior of an Integrate and Fire (IF) neuron, and the inductive behavior of a Generalized Integrate and Fire (GIF) neuron with subthreshold damped oscillations. This framework allows us to characterize the sensitivity of different model neurons to the detailed temporal structure of incoming stimuli. While a neuron with intrinsic oscillations discriminates equally well between input trains with the same or different frequency, a passive neuron discriminates better between inputs with different frequencies. This suggests that passive neurons are better suited to rate-based computation, while neurons with subthreshold oscillations are advantageous in a temporal coding scheme. We also address the influence of intrinsic properties in single-cell processing as a function of input statistics, and show that intrinsic oscillations enhance discrimination sensitivity at high input rates. Finally, we discuss how the recognition of these cell-specific discrimination properties might further our understanding of neuronal network computations and their relationships to the distribution and functional connectivity of different neuronal types.},

The cell-specific effect of STDP is particularly evident in the presence of an oscillatory component in a cell input.

However, little is discussed regarding postural or ambulation command signaling. Auditory prosthesis research continues to represent the majority of literature on BCI signal insertion. Significant hurdles continue in the technological translation of BCI implants. These include developing a stable neural interface, significantly increasing signal processing capabilities, and methods of data transfer throughout the human body.

	abstract = {In this paper, hybrid brain-computer interface (hBCI) technologies for improving classification accuracy and increasing the number of commands are reviewed. Hybridization combining more than two modalities is a new trend in brain imaging and prosthesis control. Electroencephalography (EEG), due to its easy use and fast temporal resolution, is most widely utilized in combination with other brain/non-brain signal acquisition modalities, for instance, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), electromyography (EMG), electrooculography (EOG), eye tracker, etc. Three main purposes of hybridization are to increase the number of control commands, improve classification accuracy, and reduce the signal detection time. Currently, such combinations of EEG+fNIRS and EEG+EOG are most commonly employed. Four principal components (i.e., hardware, paradigm, classifiers, features) relevant to accuracy improvement are discussed. In the case of brain signals, motor imagination/movement tasks are combined with cognitive tasks to increase active BCI accuracy. Active and reactive tasks sometimes are combined: motor imagination with steady-state evoked visual potentials (SSVEP), and motor imagination with P300, etc. In the case of reactive tasks, SSVEP is most widely combined with P300 to increase the number of commands. Passive BCIs, however, are rare. After discussing the hardware and strategies involved in the development of hBCI, the second part examines the approaches used to increase the number of control commands and to enhance classification accuracy. The future prospects and the extension of hBCI in real-time applications for daily life scenarios are provided.},

Such 'gating' involves inhibition of the thalamocortical relay neurons by the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We reconstructed the thalamocortical circuit as an artificial and biological hybrid network in vitro. With visual input simulated as retinal cell activity, we show here that when the gain in the thalamic inhibitory feedback loop is greater than a critical value, the circuit tends towards oscillations – and thus imposes a temporal decorrelation of retinal cell input and thalamic relay output. This results in the functional disconnection of the cortex from the sensory drive, a feature typical of sleep states. Conversely, low gain in the feedback inhibition and the action of noradrenaline, a known modulator of arousal, converge to increase input output correlation in relay neurons. Combining gain control of feedback inhibition and modulation of membrane excitability thus enables thalamic circuits to finely tune the gating of spike transmission from sensory organs to the cortex.},

	abstract = {Experimental neuroscience is witnessing an increased interest in the development and application of novel and often complex, closed-loop protocols, where the stimulus applied depends in real-time on the response of the system. Recent applications range from the implementation of virtual reality systems for studying motor responses both in mice(1) and in zebrafish(2), to control of seizures following cortical stroke using optogenetics(3). A key advantage of closed-loop techniques resides in the capability of probing higher dimensional properties that are not directly accessible or that depend on multiple variables, such as neuronal excitability(4) and reliability, while at the same time maximizing the experimental throughput. In this contribution and in the context of cellular electrophysiology, we describe how to apply a variety of closed-loop protocols to the study of the response properties of pyramidal cortical neurons, recorded intracellularly with the patch clamp technique in acute brain slices from the somatosensory cortex of juvenile rats. As no commercially available or open source software provides all the features required for efficiently performing the experiments described here, a new software toolbox called LCG(5) was developed, whose modular structure maximizes reuse of computer code and facilitates the implementation of novel experimental paradigms. Stimulation waveforms are specified using a compact meta-description and full experimental protocols are described in text-based configuration files. Additionally, LCG has a command-line interface that is suited for repetition of trials and automation of experimental protocols.},

	abstract = {Background: Current software tools for electrophysiological experiments are limited in flexibility and rarely offer adequate support for advanced techniques such as dynamic clamp and hybrid experiments, which are therefore limited to laboratories with a significant expertise in neuroinformatics. New method: We have developed lcg, a software suite based on a command-line interface (CLI) that allows performing both standard and advanced electrophysiological experiments. Stimulation protocols for classical voltage and current clamp experiments are defined by a concise and flexible meta description that allows representing complex waveforms as a piece-wise parametric decomposition of elementary sub-waveforms, abstracting the stimulation hardware. To perform complex experiments lcg provides a set of elementary building blocks that can be interconnected to yield a large variety of experimental paradigms. Results: We present various cellular electrophysiological experiments in which lcg has been employed, ranging from the automated application of current clamp protocols for characterizing basic electrophysiological properties of neurons, to dynamic clamp, response clamp, and hybrid experiments. We finally show how the scripting capabilities behind a CLI are suited for integrating experimental trials into complex workflows, where actual experiment, online data analysis and computational modeling seamlessly integrate. Comparison with existing methods: We compare lcg with two open source toolboxes, RTXI and RELACS. Conclusions: We believe that lcg will greatly contribute to the standardization and reproducibility of both simple and complex experiments. Additionally, on the long run the increased efficiency due to a CLI will prove a great benefit for the experimental community. ©2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The main advantage of our system over other similar stimulators is that it contains an optical fiber for signal transmission instead of metallic wires. The fiber is placed between the electronic circuit and stimulated neurons and provides galvanic isolation from external electrical and magnetic fields. The use of the optical fiber allows avoiding electromagnetic noise and current flows which could affect metallic wires. Furthermore, it gives us the possibility to simulate “synaptic plasticity” by adaptive signal transfer through optical fiber. The proposed optoelectronic system (hybrid neural circuit) provides a very high efficiency in stimulating hippocampus neurons and can be used for restoring brain activity in particular regions or replacing brain parts (neuroprosthetics) damaged due to a trauma or neurodegenerative diseases.},

	volume = {44},
	abstract = {A hybrid system in which an olivary neuron was interconnected to an analog simulator was used to study possible mechanisms by which the combined behavior of individual olivary neurons evokes synchronized membrane potential oscillations in a large population of neurons. The analog system was composed of four identical, interconnected oscillating units, each of which was capable of producing a damped sinusoidal oscillation in response to a trigger signal. When the units were coupled to each other, a single trigger pulse to one unit could evoke sustained oscillations. The integrity of the connections within the system was required to maintain these oscillations. In the hybrid system the analog system was reciprocally connected to an olivary neuron in a slice preparation. As in the analog system, the hybrid system could generate sustained oscillations following a trigger pulse to one of the units, as well as following a low threshold Ca spike in the neuron. Activation of the low threshold Ca conductance in the olivary neuron was necessary to achieve both gain and in-phase activity within the hybrid system, and thereby sustain the oscillations. The ability of the hybrid system to generate sustained oscillation is frequency dependent. Sustained oscillations were readily obtained at a "preferred frequency" of 5.2 Hz (n = 7) which was independent on the parameters used by the simulator, or on the membrane potential of the neurons. These results, which demonstrate the advantage of a new experimental approach developed to study rhythmogenesis in inferior olivary neurons, support the hypothesis that the inferior olivary nucleus, acting as an interconnected network of oscillating units, can generate an accurate subthreshold oscillation that serves as an internal time reference. ?? 1991.},

In some of these cells the ionic conductances responsible for their excitability also endow them with autorhythmic electrical oscillatory properties. Chemical or electrical synaptic contacts between these neurons often result in network oscillations. In such networks, autorhythmic neurons may act as true oscillators (as pacemakers) or as resonators (responding preferentially to certain firing frequencies). Oscillations and resonance in the CNS are proposed to have diverse functional roles, such as (i) determining global functional states (for example, sleep-wakefulness or attention), (ii) timing in motor coordination, and (iii) specifying connectivity during development. Also, oscillation, especially in the thalamo-cortical circuits, may be related to certain neurological and psychiatric disorders. This review proposes that the autorhythmic electrical properties of central neurons and their connectivity form the basis for an intrinsic functional coordinate system that provides internal context to sensory input.},

In previous research, the computational properties of subthreshold oscillations and dynamic synapses have been studied separately. Our results show that dynamic synapses can influence different aspects of the dynamics of neuronal subthreshold oscillations. Factors such as maximum hyperpolarization level, oscillation amplitude and frequency or the resulting firing threshold are modulated by synaptic depression, which can even make subthreshold oscillations disappear. This influence reshapes the postsynaptic neuron's resonant properties arising from subthreshold oscillations and leads to specific input/output relations. We also study the neuron's response to another simultaneous input in the context of this modulation, and show a distinct contextual processing as a function of the depression, in particular for detection of signals through weak synapses. Intrinsic oscillations dynamics can be combined with the characteristic time scale of the modulatory input received by a dynamic synapse to build cost-effective cell/channel-specific information discrimination mechanisms, beyond simple resonances. In this regard, we discuss the functional implications of synaptic depression modulation on intrinsic subthreshold dynamics.},

Food ingestion in this animal involves sequences of rhythmic biting movements that are initiated by the application of a chemical food stimulus to the lips and esophagus. We investigated how individual neurons contribute to various network functions that are required for the generation of feeding behavior such as rhythm generation, initiation ('decision making'), modulation and hunger and satiety. The data support the view that feeding behavior is generated by a distributed type of network organization with individual neurons often contributing to more than one network function, sharing roles with other neurons. Multitasking in a distributed type of network would be 'economically' sensible in the Lymnaea feeding system where only about 100 neurons are available to carry out a variety of complex tasks performed by millions of neurons in the vertebrate nervous system. Having complementary and potentially alternative mechanisms for network functions would also add robustness to what is a 'noisy' network where variable firing rates and synaptic strengths are commonly encountered in electrophysiological recording experiments.},

We test the hypothesis that it inhibits neurons at all levels of the feeding system, using a combination of anatomy, physiology and pharmacology. There is just one PlB in each pleural ganglion. Its axon traverses the pedal and cerebral ganglia, running into the buccal ganglia. It has neuropilar branches in the regions of the cerebral and buccal ganglia where neurons that are active during feeding also branch. Activation of the PlB blocks fictive feeding, whether the feeding rhythm occurs spontaneously or is driven by a modulatory interneuron. The PlB inhibits all the neurons in the feeding network, including protraction and retraction motoneurons, central pattern generator interneurons, buccal modulatory interneurons (SO, OC), and cerebral modulatory interneurons (CV1, CGC). Only the CV1 interneuron shows discrete 1:1 IPSPs; all other effects are slow, smooth hyperpolarizations. All connections persist in Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ -rich saline, which reduces polysynaptic effects. The inhibitory effects are mimicked by 0.5 to 100 μmoll -1 FMRFamide, which the PlB soma contains.

The analysis demonstrated strong robustness of transient dynamics in keeping not only the activation sequences but also specific cycle-by-cycle temporal relationships in the form of dynamical invariants. The rich dynamics of neurons and connections balance flexibility and coordination to readily negotiate the interactions between neurons and produce the resultant rhythm. In particular, two dynamical invariants were identified between time intervals that build the sequence, existing even outside steady states. We suggest that invariant temporal sequence relationships could be present in other networks, including those related to brain rhythms, and underlie rhythm programming and functionality.},

In these neurons, we discovered a class of calcium-mediated dendritic action potentials (dCaAPs) whose waveform and effects on neuronal output have not been previously described. In contrast to typical all-or-none action potentials, dCaAPs were graded; their amplitudes were maximal for threshold-level stimuli but dampened for stronger stimuli.

	abstract = {There is more than one way to develop neuronal complexity, and animals frequently use different molecular toolkits to achieve similar functional outcomes. Genomics and metabolomics data from basal metazoans suggest that neural signalling evolved independently in ctenophores and cnidarians/ bilaterians. This polygenesis hypothesis explains the lack of pan-neuronal and pan-synaptic genes across metazoans, including remarkable examples of lineage-specific evolution of neurogenic and signalling molecules as well as synaptic components. Sponges and placozoans are two lineages without neural and muscular systems. The possibility of secondary loss of neurons and synapses in the Porifera/Placozoa clades is a highly unlikely and less parsimonious scenario. We conclude that acetylcholine, serotonin, histamine, dopamine, octopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were recruited as transmitters in the neural systems in cnidarian and bilaterian lineages. By contrast, ctenophores independently evolved numerous secretory peptides, indicating extensive adaptations within the clade and suggesting that early neural systems might be peptidergic. Comparative analysis of glutamate signalling also shows numerous lineage-specific innovations, implying the extensive use of this ubiquitous metabolite and intercellular messenger over the course of convergent and parallel evolution of mechanisms of intercellular communication. Therefore: (i) we view a neuron as a functional character but not a genetic character, and (ii) any given neural system cannot be considered as a single character because it is composed of different cell lineages with distinct genealogies, origins and evolutionary histories. Thus, when reconstructing the evolution of nervous systems, we ought to start with the identification of particular cell lineages by establishing distant neural homologies or examples of convergent evolution. In a corollary of the hypothesis of the independent origins of neurons, our analyses suggest that both electrical and chemical synapses evolved more than once.},

	abstract = {Central pattern generators (CPGs) are networks underlying rhythmic motor behaviours and they are dynamically regulated by neuronal elements that are extrinsic or intrinsic to the rhythmogenic circuit. In the feeding system of the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, the extrinsic slow oscillator (SO) interneuron controls the frequency of the feeding rhythm and the N3t (tonic) has a dual role; it is an intrinsic CPG interneuron, but it also suppresses CPG activity in the absence of food, acting as a decision-making element in the feeding circuit. The firing patterns of the SO and N3t neurons and their synaptic connections with the rest of the CPG are known, but how these regulate network function is not well understood. This was investigated by building a computer model of the feeding network based on a minimum number of cells (N1M, N2v and N3t) required to generate the three-phase motor rhythm together with the SO that was used to activate the system. The intrinsic properties of individual neurons were represented using two-compartment models containing currents of the Hodgkin-Huxley type. Manipulations of neuronal activity in the N3t and SO neurons in the model produced similar quantitative effects to food and electrical stimulation in the biological network indicating that the model is a useful tool for studying the dynamic properties of the feeding circuit. The model also predicted novel effects of electrical stimulation of two CPG interneurons (N1M and N2v). When tested experimentally, similar effects were found in the biological system providing further validation of our model. © The Authors (2007).},

	abstract = {{\textbackslash}textlessp{\textbackslash}textgreaterWe describe the role of the octopamine-containing OC interneurons in the buccal feeding system of Lymnaea stagnalis. OC neurons are swallowing phase interneurons receiving inhibitory inputs in the N1 and N2 phases, and excitatory inputs in the N3 phase of fictive feeding. Although the OC neurons do not always fire during feeding, the feeding rate is significantly ( P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001) higher when both SO and OC fire in each cycle than when only the SO fires. In 28\% of silent preparations, a single stimulation of an OC interneuron evokes the feeding pattern. Repetitive stimulation of the OC interneuron increases the proportion of responsive preparations to 41\%. The OC interneuron not only changes both the feeding rate and reconfigures the pattern. Depolarization of the OC interneurons increases the feeding rate and removes the B3 motor neuron from the firing sequence. Hyperpolarization slows it down (increasing the duration of N1 and N3 phases) and recruits the B3 motor neuron. OC interneurons form synaptic connections onto buccal motor neurons and interneurons but not onto the cerebral (cerebral giant cell) modulatory neurons. OC interneurons are electrically coupled to all N3 phase (B4, B4Cl, B8) feeding motor neurons. They form symmetrical connections with the N3p interneurons having dual electrical (excitatory) and chemical (inhibitory) components. OC interneurons evoke biphasic synaptic inputs on the protraction phase interneurons (SO, N1L, N1M), with a short inhibition followed by a longer lasting depolarization. N2d interneurons are hyperpolarized, while N2v interneurons are slowly depolarized and often fire a burst after OC stimulation. Most motor neurons also receive synaptic responses from the OC interneurons. Although OC and N3p interneurons are both swallowing phase interneurons, their synaptic contacts onto follower neurons are usually different (e.g., the B3 motor neurons are inhibited by OC, but excited by N3p interneurons). Repetitive stimulation of OC interneuron facilitates the excitatory component of the biphasic responses evoked on the SO, N1L, and N1M interneurons, but neither the N2 nor the N3 phase interneurons display a similar longer-lasting excitatory effect. OC interneurons are inhibited by all the buccal feeding interneurons, but excited by the serotonergic modulatory CGC neurons. We conclude that OC interneurons are a new kind of swallowing phase interneurons. Their connections with the buccal feeding interneurons can account for their modulatory effects on the feeding rhythm. As they contain octopamine, this is the first example in Lymnaea that monoaminergic modulation and reconfiguration are provided by an intrinsic member of the buccal feeding network.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater},

	abstract = {In the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis octopamine-containing (OC) interneurons trigger and reconfigure the feeding pattern in isolated CNS by excitation of the central pattern generator. In semi-intact (lip-mouth-CNS) preparations, this central pattern generator is activated by chemosensory inputs. We now test if sucrose application to the lips activates the OC neurons independently of the rest of the feeding central pattern generator, or if the OC interneuron is activated by inputs from the feeding network. In 66\% of experiments, sucrose stimulated feeding rhythms and OC interneurons received regular synaptic inputs. Only rarely (14\%) did the OC interneuron fire action potentials, proving that firing of OC interneurons is not necessary for the sucrose-induced feeding. Prestimulation of OC neurons increased the intensity and duration of the feeding rhythm evoked by subsequent sucrose presentations. One micromolar octopamine in the CNS bath mimicked the effect of OC interneuron stimulation, enhancing the feeding response when sucrose is applied to the lips. We conclude that the modulatory OC neurons are not independently excited by chemosensory inputs to the lips, but rather from the buccal central pattern generator network. However, when OC neurons fire, they release modulatory octopamine, which provides a positive feedback to the network to enhance the sucrose-activated central pattern generator rhythm. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

	abstract = {The interaction between synaptic and intrinsic dynamics can efficiently shape neuronal input-output relationships in response to temporally structured spike trains. We use a neuron model with subthreshold oscillations receiving inputs through a synapse with short-term depression and facilitation to show that the combination of intrinsic subthreshold and synaptic dynamics leads to channel-specific nontrivial responses and recognition of specific temporal structures. We employ the Generalized Integrate-and-Fire (GIF) model, which can be subjected to analytical characterization. We map the temporal structure of spike input trains to the type of spike response, and show how the emergence of nontrivial input-output preferences is modulated by intrinsic and synaptic parameters in a synergistic manner. We demonstrate that these temporal input discrimination properties are robust to noise and to variations in synaptic strength, suggesting that they likely contribute to neuronal computation in biological circuits. Furthermore, we also illustrate the presence of these input-output relationships in conductance-based models. Author summary Neuronal subthreshold oscillations underlie key aspects of information processing in single neuron and network dynamics. Dynamic synapses provide a channel-specific temporal modulation of input information. We combine a neuron model that displays subthreshold oscillations and a dynamic synapse to analytically assess their interplay in processing trains of spike-mediated synaptic currents. Our results show that the co-action of intrinsic and synaptic dynamics builds nontrivial input-output relationships, which are resistant to noise and to changes in synaptic strength. The discrimination of a precise temporal structure of the input signal is shaped as a function of the joint interaction of intrinsic oscillations and synaptic dynamics. This interaction can result in channel-specific recognition of precise temporal patterns, hence greatly expanding the flexibility and complexity in information processing achievable by individual neurons with respect to temporal discrimination mechanisms based on intrinsic neuronal dynamics alone.},

	abstract = {Intracellular recordings were made from rhythm-generating interneurons in the Lymnaea feeding system. The feeding pattern is a three-phase rhythm of interneuronal activity (N1, N2, N3) corresponding to protraction, rasp, and swallow. We describe the firing pattern and anatomy of the premotor interneurons, each of which fires a predominant burst in only one phase of the feeding rhythm. The rhythm can be driven by steady depolarization of N1 cells. The phase of the rhythm is reset by brief stimulation of N2 or N3 interneurons. N1 neurons excite the N2 interneurons, and these in turn inhibit the N1 cells. This recurrent inhibitory pathway can account for the switch from the N1 phase of the feeding cycles to the N2 phase. The endogenous properties of the N2 interneurons are apparently responsible for the termination of N2 bursts. N3 interneurons display postinhibitory rebound (PIR), and this probably contributes to their burst after the end of the N2 inhibitory input. N2 and N3 interneurons inhibit the N1 cells. When the N3 burst dies away, activity in N1 cells resumes under the stimulus of depolarizing current. Interactions between interneurons are mainly by discrete, monophasic postsynaptic potentials, that follow 1:1. They have relatively short latency (2-12 ms) and duration (up to 100 ms). The synaptic connections between the three types of premotor interneurons are sufficient to account for the sequence of activity seen during feeding.},

Individual neurons can be identified as parts of behavioral circuits and their synaptic connectivities determined by electrophysiological recording. The ability to grow Lymnaea neurons in cell culture has allowed the in vitro reconstruction of synapses and neural circuits. Early work focused on using Lymnaea giant neurons to analyse the biophysical properties of neurons or investigated the organization of neuroendocrine peptidergic neural networks involved in growth and reproduction. Since then the neural networks underlying a variety of reflexive and rhythmic behaviors have been investigated including feeding, respiration, defensive withdrawal, locomotion, gravity orientation, and reproduction (copulation and egg-laying). Many of these behaviours are highly dynamic leading to exciting recent studies on the neural and molecular mechanisms underlying simple forms of memory formation (Benjamin et al., 2000; Benjamin \& Kemenes, 2010).},

Here we present the first study that investigates the modulatory actions of the CGCs and their released transmitter 5-HT on the CPG at the cellular level. In the snail, Lymnaea, motoneurons such as the B4, B8, and B4CL cells are part of the feeding CPG and receive serotonergic synaptic inputs from CGCs. These motoneurons were used to investigate the effect of serotonergic modulation on endogenous cellular properties of CPG neurons. Cells were isolated from the intact nervous system, and their properties were examined by pharmacological methods in cell culture. Motoneurons were also grown in coculture with CGCs to compare 5-HT effects with CGC stimulation. Three distinct modulatory effects of exogenously applied 5-HT/CGC activity were seen: all three motoneuron types were depolarized by 5-HT for prolonged periods leading to firing. Conditional bursting accompanied this depolarization in the B4/B8 cells, but not in B4CL cells. The frequency of the bursting was increased with increased CGC tonic firing. An increase in the size of postinhibitory rebound (PIR) occurred with 5-HT application in all three cell types, because of an increase in a CsCl-sensitive, hyperpolarization-activated inward current. Similar modulatory effects on membrane potential, endogenous bursting, and PIR properties could be observed in the intact nervous system and were necessary for motoneuron activation during feeding. Part of the systems gating and frequency control functions of the CGCs appear to be caused by these modulatory effects on feeding motoneurons.},

	abstract = {Understanding central pattern generator (CPG) circuits requires a detailed knowledge of the intrinsic cellular properties of the constituent neurons. These properties are poorly understood in most CPGs because of the complexity resulting from interactions with other neurons of the circuit. This is also the case in the feeding network of the snail, Lymnaea, one of the best-characterized CPG networks. We addressed this problem by isolating the interneurons comprising the feeding CPG in cell culture, which enabled us to study their basic intrinsic electrical and pharmacological cellular properties without interference from other network components. These results were then related to the activity patterns of the neurons in the intact feeding network. The most striking finding was the intrinsic generation of plateau potentials by medial N1 (N1M) interneurons. This property is probably critical for rhythm generation in the whole feeding circuit because the N1M interneurons are known to play a pivotal role in the initiation of feeding cycles in response to food. Plateau potential generation in another cell type, the ventral N2 (N2v), appeared to be conditional on the presence of acetylcholine. Examination of the other isolated feeding CPG interneurons [lateral N1 (N1L), dorsal N2 (N2d), phasic N3 (N3p)] and the modulatory slow oscillator (SO) revealed no significant intrinsic properties in relation to pattern generation. Instead, their firing patterns in the circuit appear to be determined largely by cholinergic and glutamatergic synaptic inputs from other CPG interneurons, which were mimicked in culture by application of these transmitters. This is an example of a CPG system where the initiation of each cycle appears to be determined by the intrinsic properties of a key interneuron, N1M, but most other features of the rhythm are probably determined by network interactions.},

The storage size of the corresponding process is large because of the permutation capacity as a function of control signals in ensembles of these patterns. Extracting low-dimensional functional dynamics from multiple large-scale neural populations is a central problem both in neuro- and cognitive- sciences. Experimental results in the last decade represent a solid base for the creation of low-dimensional models of different cognitive functions and allow moving towards a dynamical theory of consciousness. We discuss here a methodology to build simple kinetic equations that can be the mathematical skeleton of this theory. Models of the corresponding discrete information processing can be designed using the following dynamical principles: (i) clusterization of the neural activity in space and time and formation of information patterns; (ii) robustness of the sequential dynamics based on heteroclinic chains of metastable clusters; and (iii) sensitivity of such sequential dynamics to intrinsic and external informational signals. We analyze sequential discrete coding based on winnerless competition low-frequency dynamics. Under such dynamics, entrainment and heteroclinic coordination leads to a large variety of coding regimes that are invariant in time.},

We show that the stereotyped sequences in RA are driven from nucleus HVC (high vocal centre), the principal pre-motor input to RA3,4. Recordings of identified HVC neurons in sleeping and singing birds show that individual HVC neurons projecting onto RA neurons produce bursts sparsely, at a single, precise time during the RA sequence. These HVC neurons burst sequentially with respect to one another. We suggest that at each time in the RA sequence, the ensemble of active RA neurons is driven by a subpopulation of RA-projecting HVC neurons that is active only at that time. As a population, these HVC neurons may form an explicit representation of time in the sequence. Such a sparse representation, a temporal analogue of the ‘grandmother cell'5 concept for object recognition, eliminates the problem of temporal interference during sequence generation and learning attributed to more distributed representations6,7.},

	abstract = {The extent to which individual neural networks can produce phase-constant motor patterns as cycle frequency is altered has not been studied extensively. I investigated this issue in the well-defined, rhythmic pyloric neural network. When pyloric cycle frequency is altered three- to fivefold, pyloric inter-neuronal delays shift by hundreds to thousands of msec, and all pyloric pattern elements show strong phase maintenance. The experimental paradigm used is unlikely to activate exogenous inputs to the network, and these delay changes are thus likely to arise from phase-compensatory mechanisms intrinsic to the network. Pyloric inter-neuronal delays depend on the time constants of the network's synapses and of the membrane properties of its neurons. The observed delay shifts thus suggest that, in response to changes in overall cycle frequency, these constants vary so as to maintain pattern phasing.},

These protocols are often difficult to implement due to the temporal precision required when interacting with biological components, which in many cases can only be achieved using real-time technology. In this paper we introduce RTHybrid (www.github.com/GNB-UAM/RTHybrid), a free and open-source software that includes a neuron and synapse model library to build hybrid circuits with living neurons in a wide variety of experimental contexts. In an effort to encourage the standardization of real-time software technology in neuroscience research, we compared different open-source real-time operating system patches, RTAI, Xenomai 3 and Preempt-RT, according to their performance and usability. RTHybrid has been developed to run over Linux operating systems supporting both Xenomai 3 and Preempt-RT real-time patches, and thus allowing an easy implementation in any laboratory. We report a set of validation tests and latency benchmarks for the construction of hybrid circuits using this library. With this work we want to promote the dissemination of standardized, user-friendly and open-source software tools developed for open- and closed-loop experimental neuroscience.},

	abstract = {Optogenetic is a technique that combines optics and genetics to control specific neurons. This technique usually uses adenoviruses that encode photosensitive protein. The adenovirus may concentrate in a specific neural region. By shining light on the target nerve region, the photosensitive protein encoded by the adenovirus is controlled. Photosensitive proteins controlled by light can selectively allow ions inside and outside the cell membrane to pass through, resulting in inhibition or activation effects. Due to the precision and minimally invasive, optogenetics has achieved good results in many fields, especially in the field of neuron functions and neural circuits. Significant advances have also been made in the study of many clinical diseases. This review focuses on the research of optogenetics in the field of neurobiology. These include how to use optogenetics to control nerve cells, study neural circuits, and treat diseases by changing the state of neurons. We hoped that this review will give a comprehensive understanding of the progress of optogenetics in the field of neurobiology.},

Most studies deal with high-frequency pulsed protocols and stationary characterizations disregarding the dynamic modulatory effect of sustained and activity-dependent stimulation. The understanding of such modulation and its widespread dissemination can help to develop specific interventions for research applications and treatments for neural disorders.AimWe quantified the effect of continuous-wave near-infrared (CW-NIR) laser illumination on single neuron dynamics using sustained stimulation and an open-source activity-dependent protocol to identify the biophysical mechanisms underlying this modulation and its time course.ApproachWe characterized the effect by simultaneously performing long intracellular recordings of membrane potential while delivering sustained and closed-loop CW-NIR laser stimulation. We used waveform metrics and conductance-based models to assess the role of specific biophysical candidates on the modulation.ResultsWe show that CW-NIR sustained illumination asymmetrically accelerates action potential dynamics and the spiking rate on single neurons, while closed-loop stimulation unveils its action at different phases of the neuron dynamics. Our model study points out the action of CW-NIR on specific ionic-channels and the key role of temperature on channel properties to explain the modulatory effect.ConclusionsBoth sustained and activity-dependent CW-NIR stimulation effectively modulate neuronal dynamics by a combination of biophysical mechanisms. Our open-source protocols can help to disseminate this non-invasive optical stimulation in novel research and clinical applications.},

	abstract = {The levels of voltage-gated and synaptic currents in the same neuron type can vary substantially across individuals. Yet, the phase relationships between neurons in oscillatory circuits are often maintained, even in the face of varying oscillation frequencies. We examined whether synaptic and intrinsic currents are matched to maintain constant activity phases across preparations, using the lateral pyloric (LP) neuron of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab, Cancer borealis. LP produces stable oscillatory bursts on release from inhibition, with an onset phase that is independent of oscillation frequency. We quantified the parameters that define the shape of the synaptic current inputs across preparations and found no linear correlations with voltage-gated currents. However, several synaptic parameters were correlated with oscillation period and burst onset phase, suggesting they may play a role in phase maintenance. We used dynamic clamp to apply artificial synaptic inputs and found that those synaptic parameters correlated with phase and period were ineffective in influencing burst onset. Instead, parameters that showed the least variability across preparations had the greatest influence. Thus, parameters that influence circuit phasing are constrained across individuals, while those that have little effect simply co-vary with phase and frequency.},

We draw on these to propose a minimal model of a bursting neuron, identifying biophysical parameters that can shape and regulate key characteristics of the membrane voltage pattern: bursting frequency, duty cycle, spike rate, and the number of action potentials per burst. We present additional examples from the literature for comparison and illustration, and in a companion paper [SIAM J. Appl. Dyn.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rhythmic motor behaviors can be generated continuously (e.g., breathing) or episodically (e.g., locomotion, swallowing), when short or long bouts of rhythmic activity are interspersed with periods of quiescence. Although the mechanisms of rhythm generation are known in detail in many systems, there is very little understanding of how the episodic nature of rhythmic behavior is produced at the neuronal level.
RESULTS: Using a well-established episodic rhythm-generating neural circuit controlling molluscan feeding, we demonstrate that quiescence between bouts of activity arises from active, maintained inhibition of an otherwise rhythmically active network. We show that the source of the suppressive drive is within the circuit itself; a single central pattern generator (CPG) interneuron type that fires tonically to inhibit feeding during quiescence. Suppression of the tonic activity of this neuron by food is sufficient to change the network from an inactive to a rhythmically active state, with the cell switching function to fire phasically as part of the food-evoked rhythmogenesis. Furthermore, the absolute level of intrinsic suppressive control is modulated extrinsically by the animal's behavioral state (e.g., hunger/satiety), increasing the probability of episodes of feeding when the animal is hungry.
CONCLUSIONS: By utilizing the same intrinsic member of a CPG network in both rhythm-generation and suppression, this system has developed a simple and efficient mechanism for generating a variable level of response to suit the animal's changing behavioral demands.},
