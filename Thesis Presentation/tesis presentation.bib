  abstract = {The aim of the work reviewed here is to relate the properties of individual neurons to network organization and behavior using the feeding system of the gastropod mollusk, Lymnaea. Food ingestion in this animal involves sequences of rhythmic biting movements that are initiated by the application of a chemical food stimulus to the lips and esophagus. We investigated how individual neurons contribute to various network functions that are required for the generation of feeding behavior such as rhythm generation, initiation ('decision making'), modulation and hunger and satiety. The data support the view that feeding behavior is generated by a distributed type of network organization with individual neurons often contributing to more than one network function, sharing roles with other neurons. Multitasking in a distributed type of network would be 'economically' sensible in the Lymnaea feeding system where only about 100 neurons are available to carry out a variety of complex tasks performed by millions of neurons in the vertebrate nervous system. Having complementary and potentially alternative mechanisms for network functions would also add robustness to what is a 'noisy' network where variable firing rates and synaptic strengths are commonly encountered in electrophysiological recording experiments.},

  abstract = {By studying different sources of temporal variability in central pattern generator circuits, in this paper we unveil distinct aspects of the instantaneous balance between flexibility and robustness in sequential dynamics -a property that characterizes many systems that display neural rhythms. The level of irregularity and coordination was characterized using intrinsic time references and intervals in long recordings of the pyloric central pattern generator. The analysis demonstrated strong robustness of transient dynamics in keeping not only the activation sequences but also specific cycle-by-cycle temporal relationships in the form of dynamical invariants. The rich dynamics of neurons and connections balance flexibility and coordination to readily negotiate the interactions between neurons and produce the resultant rhythm. In particular, two dynamical invariants were identified between time intervals that build the sequence, existing even outside steady states. We suggest that invariant temporal sequence relationships could be present in other networks, including those related to brain rhythms, and underlie rhythm programming and functionality.},

  abstract = {Optical control of neuronal activity has a number of advantages over electrical methods and can be conveniently applied to intact individual neurons in vivo. In this study, we demonstrated an experimental approach in which a focused continuous near-infrared (CNI) laser beam was used to activate single rat hippocampal neurons by transiently elevating the local temperature. Reversible changes in the amplitude and kinetics of neuronal voltage-gated Na and K channel currents were recorded following irradiation with a single-mode 980 nm CNI-laser. Using single-channel recordings under controlled temperatures as a means of calibration, it was estimated that temperature at the neuron rose by 14{$^\circ$}C in 500 ms. Computer simulation confirmed that small temperature changes of about 5{$^\circ$}C were sufficient to produce significant changes in neuronal excitability. The method should be broadly applicable to studies of neuronal activity under physiological conditions, in particular studies of temperature-sensing neurons expressing thermoTRP channels. {\copyright} 2008 Humana Press Inc.},

  abstract = {Background: Transcranial laser stimulation is a novel method of noninvasive brain stimulation found safe and effective for improving prefrontal cortex neurocognitive functions in healthy young adults. This method is different from electric and magnetic stimulation because it causes the photonic oxidation of cytochrome-c-oxidase, the rate-limiting enzyme for oxygen consumption and the major intracellular acceptor of photons from near-infrared light. This photobiomodulation effect promotes mitochondrial respiration, cerebrovascular oxygenation and neurocognitive function. Pilot studies suggest that transcranial photobiomodulation may also induce beneficial effects in aging individuals. Objectives: Randomized, sham-controlled study to test photobiomodulation effects caused by laser stimulation on cytochrome-c-oxidase oxidation and hemoglobin oxygenation in the prefrontal cortex of 68 healthy younger and older adults, ages 18--85. Methods: Broadband near-infrared spectroscopy was used for the noninvasive quantification of bilateral cortical changes in oxidized cytochrome-c-oxidase and hemoglobin oxygenation before, during and after 1064-nm wavelength laser (IR-A laser, area: 13.6 cm2, power density: 250 mW/cm2) or sham stimulation of the right anterior prefrontal cortex (Brodmann Area 10). Results: As compared to sham control, there was a significant laser-induced increase in oxidized cytochrome-c-oxidase during laser stimulation, followed by a significant post-stimulation increase in oxygenated hemoglobin and a decrease in deoxygenated hemoglobin. Furthermore, there was a greater laser-induced effect on cytochrome-c-oxidase with increasing age, while laser-induced effects on cerebral hemodynamics decreased with increasing age. No adverse laser effects were found. Conclusion: The findings support the use of transcranial photobiomodulation for cerebral oxygenation and alleviation of age-related decline in mitochondrial respiration. They justify further research on its therapeutic potential in neurologic and psychiatric diseases.},

  abstract = {The Cerebral Giant Cells (CGCs) are a pair of identifi ed modulatory interneurons in the Central Nervous System of the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis with an important role in the expression of both unconditioned and conditioned feeding behavior. Following single-trial food-reward classical conditioning, the membrane potential of the CGCs becomes persistently depolarized. This depolarization contributes to the conditioned response by facilitating sensory cell to command neuron synapses, which results in the activation of the feeding network by the conditioned stimulus. Despite the depolarization of the membrane potential, which enables the CGGs to play a key role in learning-induced network plasticity, there is no persistent change in the tonic fi ring rate or shape of the action potentials, allowing these neurons to retain their normal network function in feeding. In order to understand the ionic mechanisms of this novel combination of plasticity and stability of intrinsic electrical properties, we fi rst constructed and validated a Hodgkin-Huxley-type model of the CGCs. We then used this model to elucidate how learninginduced changes in a somal persistent sodium and a delayed rectifi er potassium current lead to a persistent depolarization of the CGCs whilst maintaining their fi ring rate. Including in the model an additional increase in the conductance of a high-voltage-activated calcium current allowed the spike amplitude and spike duration also to be maintained after conditioning. We conclude therefore that a balanced increase in three identifi ed conductances is suffi cient to explain the electrophysiological changes found in the CGCs after classical conditioning. {\copyright} 2010 Vavoulis.},
